You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Met her at a party in the hills, yeah
She just wanna do it for the thrill, yeah
Shorty drive a poodle with no top (Top, top)

I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder

I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday,

You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh"

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya
[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one"

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"""

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side"

Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back

But girl, please tell me

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier"

Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other"

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer"

Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?

When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'

I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry

I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit

The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice"

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door"

High
, high hopes
[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (
High, high hopes
)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
[Verse 1]
Mama said,
 ""Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything""
Mama said,
 
""Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history,
 light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything""
[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said ""Don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting"""

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh"

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
[Chorus]
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
[Post-Chorus]
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night"

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
 
(
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like"""

I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again
[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you
[Chorus]
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again"

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up"

Maniac
[Verse 1]
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my 
home
, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
[Pre-Chorus]
People like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash
[Chorus]
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever"

Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship,
 
we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face"

Otra noche que, llamó pa' verme
Tiene kush y haze también, pero sola no prende
[Refrán: Zion]
(Z-Diddy)
Dice que no fuma, pero si yo prendo, ella le da, ella le da
Me dio un beso y le sentí allá abajo la humedad, uh-yeh
Es como andar en el mar navegando a ciegas
Eres una fantasma y no dejas que te vea
[Coro: Myke Towers & 
Farruko
]
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va'
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da (
Pu-pum
)
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va' (
Viene' y te va'
)
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da
[Verso 1: Sech]
(Este es Se')
Es que si se da después del concierto
Quedamo' adentro de tu apartamento
Tú no ere' de aquí, lo noto por tu acento
No es amor, pero grita: ""¡Lo siento!""
Yo no soy de darle repeat, siempre lo escribo en lo' tweet'
Voy a hacer un tutorial, pa' que te olvides de mí
Que no me saca de su mente
Que regrese, que quedó caliente
Otra noche que, llamó pa' verme

Und ich weiß nicht, warum, ja, aber das Gefühl ist gut
Siehst du das nicht? Ja, Schatz, du bist genau das Richtige für mich
Oh, wir waren füreinander bestimmt
Im Mondlicht zu tanzen
Die Sterne anzuschauen, so hell
Dich zu halten bis zum Sonnenaufgang
Schlafen bis Mitternacht

I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (what?)
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't (she can't)
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (coupe)

I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost

When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost

Thought about everything you were never even wrong

Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words

I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

We're stressed out
[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter"

Yo, left, yo, left

Yo, left, right, left

(
Yo, left, yo, left

(
Yo, left, right, left

(
Yo, left, yo, left

Yo, left, yo, left

Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us

Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

To explain in due time, 
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
watch you go

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake

He turned to me as if to say

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like"

I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by"

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now, I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm
[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved"

Throwin' that dirt all on my name

You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight
[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, huh
[Verse 2]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you looking up to me and talking down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the ""I Am"" (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam,
 
in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close, I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back,
 
yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, popping
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""Issa knife!"" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all"

[Refrán: Lunay, 
Mau y Ricky
]
Aunque 'taba buscando, yo sigo guardándote a ti el lugar (Lugar)
Y por más que lo intente yo sé que ninguno te va a cambiar (
Hmm
)
Yo ya casi ni duermo por andar mirando mi celular
Por si acaso a ti se te olvidaba que no me querías llamar (
Oh-oh, oh-oh
)
[Pre-Coro: Mau y Ricky]
Mi cuerpo te necesita
Mi boca te necesita (Yeh)
¿Por qué no vienes ahorita?
[Coro: Mau y Ricky & 
Camilo
]
Que me muero por besarte la boca, mamá
Hace tiempo que me sueño volverla a probar
Porque bailas como nadie más sabe bailar
Te pareces a la playa y las olas del mar
[Verso 1: Lunay]
(Lunay; yeh-yeh)
Baby, hoy yo te voy a robar pa' hacerte cositas de má'
Prende pa' despejar (-pejar)
Sólo quiero una noche de esas para recordar
Haciéndolo eres vicio, yo no te puedo dejar
Compre pa'l de botella' y ninguna nos bebemo'
Porque no aguantamo' las ganas que nos tenemo'
Ay, baby, tú me miras y ya nos entendemo'
Yo creo que es un pecado como quiera nos comemo'"

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you"

We took the floor and she said

[Verse 1]
Oh, life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
[Verse 2]
Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up"

Ocho de la noche hora local
Yo iba perdida por esta ciudad
La luna fue mi guía, dentro de Gran Vía
Y sin buscarte me ibas a encontrar
[Pre-Coro]
Y tú llegaste a preguntarme como estás
Que guapa, se ve que no eres de acá
Oh no no, oh no no
[Coro]
Oye Pablo, yo no te estaba esperando
Y me dejaste aquí pidiendo más
Un poco más, poquito más
Oye Pablo, tú tienes alma de gitano
Si te hubieras quedado un poco más
Poquito más, tantito más
[Verso 2]
Me viste desde lejos sola caminar
Con solo una mirada me hiciste temblar
Ya estaba imaginando, mi alma desnudando
Y sin querer, que tonta, di el número mal
[Pre-Coro]
Y tú llegaste a preguntarme como estás
Que guapa, se ve que no eres de acá
Oh no no, oh no no"

Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through

And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins

I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
(no.use)
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I don't eat
You visit in my bad dreams so on nights when I'm lonely you're still right here holding me
But morning's as dark as the evening before it and it's getting harder to breathe all alone
It's only me
My heart is broke and it don't believe you're gone
But the sleeve of scars on my arms brings you along to haunt me wherever I go
I won't move on yet
Something about this loss is just impossible to process
So I obsess over what could've been and how I wasn't enough
Tryna change myself for someone else and punching mirrors till I'm covered in blood"

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Yeah, hey, yay

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end"

[Part 1]
Warum fickt ihr Kopf, Kopf?
Mein Kopf platzt, Gucci-Sandalen, ich trag' sie nur aus Trotz, Trotz
Trotzdem machen sie mir nach, kann's nicht glauben, lieber Gott
Gott sei Dank schützt du mich, wenn meine Wespe ma' wieder rollt
Wenn sie rollt
 
(Brrm)
Bin auf dem Weg
Mit meinem Baby, sie sticht zu, geht besser aus dem Weg
Mit zehn PS in deine Stadt, es wird nicht angenehm
Zähl' auf meine Wespe und jetzt bringt sie euch zum Schafe zähl'n
Na-na-ne (Na-na-ne)
Eins-gegen-eins, er kriegt 'ne Bombe, ruft sein'n Bro, aber vergisst, mein Abi boxt sein'n Abi
Cruis' mit offenen Haaren und hinter mir sitzt eine Bitch like Barbie, Hood-Safari
Steig' auf die Speedfight, scheiß auf Kawasaki, let's go, Barbie
Kickdown, mit siebzig auf eure Party
 
(Brrm)
[Hook]
Sie machen Fotos, Taschen platzen, aber Apache bleibt gleich
 
(Brrm)
Brudi, ich muss los, wenn die Roller wieder schrei'n 
(Brrm)
Reden mir von Koks und von Messerstecherei'n 
(Brrm)
Doch sie müssen los, wenn unsre Roller wieder schrei'n

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)
[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights,
 
the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
 Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)"

You've got the devil in your eyes
You went and took me by surprise

If you wanna hit the road then let's go then

What it really means to live life golden

Yeah, we're golden, babygirl, we're golden

I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope

Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Climb right in, let me break your heart"

Zero hour 9 a.m.​​

On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no

Rocket man
 
burnin' out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour"

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

Can't help but check my phone
I could've made you mine
But no, it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you
And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy
[Chorus]
And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else
More beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world"

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?

The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time"
221,Take Me To Church,Hozier,80,Hozier,2014-07-20,pop,241688,"[Verse 1]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life"

I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'

[Strophe 1: P!nk]
Von Anfang an
Warst du ein Dieb, du hast mein Herz gestohlen
Und ich war dein williges Opfer
Ich ließ dich die Seiten von mir sehen
Die nicht so schön waren
Und mit jeder Berührung hast du sie repariert
[Pre-Refrain: P!nk]
Jetzt hast du im Schlaf gesprochen
Oh, oh, Dinge, die du nie zu mir sagst
Oh, oh, sagst mir, dass du genug hast
Von unserer Liebe, unserer Liebe
[Refrain: P!nk]
Gib mir nur einen Grund
Nur ein bisschen ist genug
Nur eine Sekunde, wir sind nicht gebrochen, nur gekrümmt
Und wir können wieder lieben lernen
Es ist in den Sternen
Es ist in den Narben auf unseren Herzen geschrieben
Wir sind nicht gebrochen, nur gekrümmt
Und wir können wieder lieben lernen"

Ah
Yeah, woo
Hey, yeah, ah
Ooh, yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
I wanna dance
[Verse 1]
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
[Pre-Chorus]
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And 
when the night falls
The loneliness calls
[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me"

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we, mistaken?
[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Doo, doo, doo, doo

[Verso 1: Natti Natasha & 
Romeo Santos
]
La mejor versión de mí, no la conociste tú
Porque siempre me frenaste con tu pésima actitud
Nunca pude ser quien era por amarte a tu manera
Me olvidé hasta de ser yo
Let me finesse this track (Remix)
[Verso 2: Romeo Santos]
La mejor versión de ti, no la he merecido yo
Reconozco cada fallo, estropeé tu corazón
Por complejos de ser rey, mi forma devastadora
Ignoraba tu corona
Y hoy se cambian los papeles, se acabó mi suerte
Los llantos que he causado los pago con creces
Por mi dictadura, por mis idioteces
Termino en un remix sufriendo por perderte
Es que estoy aquí
Observando la mejor versión de ti (Oh-uoh-oh, uh-uh-uh)
Es el karma de la vida, vean lo que me toca
Hoy que ya no eres mía, yo te haría mi esposa
Malgasté tu tiempo, arruiné tu cuento
Tú fuiste demasiado y yo poca cosa
[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Natti, estoy aquí, observando la mejor versión de ti (Listen)
Yo te hice sufrir, tú viviste la peor versión de mí"

[Verse 1]
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but
[Chorus]
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
[Verse 2]
Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe"

On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing

[Part 1]
Jetzt sagen sie 
„Habibi“
 und fragen, wie's mir geht
Immer nur Termine, ich sage „Désolé!“
Leider ist es grade schwierig, bin wieder ma' zu spät
Und keins deiner Ziele liegt auf meinem Weg
Pack' die brandneue 
Louis-Tasche
 ein, mach' den Kofferraum zu
Heute weder Loch im Bauch, Dicka, noch in mein'n Schuh'n
Seh' den Tisch für mich frisch gedeckt, wenn ich aufwache
Deshalb wollt ich's ausm Ghetto rausschaffen
Grade Mitte zwanzig und lebe mein'n Traum
Assi arrogant, doch erhelle jeden Raum
Ohne Sinn oder Verstand, vielleicht geh' ich bald drauf
Aber wenigstens hab' ich dann geraucht
[Hook]
Ich lade den Colt
Egal, wann ihr wollt
Der Wagen, er rollt
Und wir fahr'n Richtung Gold, fahr'n Richtung Gold
Ich lade den Colt
Egal, wann ihr wollt
Und der Wagen, er rollt
Bruder, wir fahr'n Richtung Gold, fahr'n Richtung Gold"

Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort
[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right?
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself, and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils"

Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long
[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & 
Daddy Yankee
]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (
Oh, yeah
)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, 
Daddy Yankee

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)"

275,Should I Stay or Should I Go - Remastered,The Clash,79,Combat Rock (Remastered),1982,rock,188987,"As his cab turned by the end of the Pont Royal towards the Gare d'Orsay, M. Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.
""Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired.
The porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of Beaulieu.
Still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.
""The Luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""Lead the way, and I will follow.""
It was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.
""You want the express, sir?""
""No, the slow train, my man.""
The porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.
""Do you like the front or the back of the train?""
""The back by choice.""
""First-class, isn't it?""
""Yes, first-class."""

But I show up to the showdown
To show off when the show's on for all of the crowd!)

Haha...fuckin' he
""I like to talk about multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
Stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause you got this humongous-
Shuffle T
Haha...fuckin' he
""Oh I wrote the book on multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
You stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?
Ancient tribes?
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe
No, conspiracy theories
Children of 
The Matrix

David Icke
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype
He looked me dead in the face, and right
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""
""Complicated rhymes?!""
""Yeah. Multisyllabics
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it
Why would I go to a club and get plastered
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""
I'm joking
He's kissed a girl before
Have you kissed a girl before?
He's kissed a girl before
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced
The man even pointed a score
Give her just under a four
She laughed it off
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more
Fuckin' run for the door
Fuckin' guy
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times
Got you lookin' like you come disguised
As a cunt that likes the under 5's
Nonce!
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat
He hasn't washed it in years
He takes it off and it stands on it's own
That coat is alive
It's symbiosis
It demands the controls when attached to a host
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned
""Oooh yeah.""
""Oooh ye-""
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like 
Dexter's Lab
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched
I had to get a [?]
Fuck that coat!
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?
Baow!
That's my first round in, safe star blessed
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!"

You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored"

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old
[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old
[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old

Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you

And my heart is hurting
You will always be around

Morgan v. Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974
THE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. ""Yeah,"" a new friend says, ""Whas up. Whas goin on."" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. 
""Before we start this next record…,"" Schooly's saying.
 
The record in question is called ""Signifying Rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of
 
Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.
The black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then.
 On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""Them"" from wherever it is ""They"" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.
Uniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. 
Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen.
 And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting 
the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.
Not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with 
James Brown over the radio.
""Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud!""
Except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, ""I'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.
""Say it loud
I'm mmm hum proud
Say it loud
Mum hum hum proud!""
But rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:"

292,Low (feat. T-Pain),Flo Rida,79,Mail on Sunday,2008-03-17,pop,231400,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Quer viver a minha vida? Faz cem mil sem esforço
Ahn, se eu quiser ela deixa eu pôr no osso
Se meu som é uma droga, geral quer sentir o gosto
Todo mundo quer andar com o que eu tenho no pescoço
Então, cuidado pra não se cegar
Que ficar encarando o Sol, não vai te ajudar
Todo mundo quer ser estrela
Mas não tem lugar no Sol, que o Tuê já tá por lá
Então, vem, vem balançar, sem enganação
Eu sou ruim e vou roubar tua alma até o fim da canção
No show cantei ""Morte do Autotune,"" ela rebolou o bundão
Não fez sentido, mas que bela visão
[Pré-Refrão]
Tudo que nós faz vai ter que ser pro coração, são
Tô mandado um salve pros irmãos
Pra aqueles que nunca vacilaram na missão
Ontem era balão, hoje nós só fuma verde no carrão (Uh), yeah

Hoje o trap faz dinheiro OG
Tô transando no canto ao som de Kenny G (Uh), yeah
Foda-se, eu odeio Hennessy
E a maioria desses trapper são uns mini-me (Uh), ayy

Quem não é Tuê, é carta fora do baralho (Uh)

[Verso 1: Mike Bahía]
¿Dime qué haces aquí
Cuando se suponía, que no volverías?
¿A qué se debe tu perdón?
Jugando a que te vas y vuelves
Así siempre la resuelves, como si no doliera
[Coro: Mike Bahía & 
Danny Ocean
]
Detente
Si lo tuyo no se llama amor
Te pido por favor, de todo corazón
No jueges con mi mente, yeah, eh-eh
Fue suficiente con aquella vez que dijiste ""Adiós""
Pa' nunca más volver, y siempre vuelves (Woh, oh)
Siempre vuelves (Ah, ah)
Detente (Eh)
Si lo tuyo no se llama amor
Entonces, no lo intentes (No lo intentes), oh, oh
Fue suficiente con aquella vez que dijiste ""Adiós""
Pa' nunca más volver, y siempre vuelves (
Oh, oh; Ba-babylon, girl
)
Siempre vuelves (
Oh, oh; Ba-babylon, girl
)
[Verso 1: Danny Ocean]
Ya que te fuiste, mujer, y planea' volver
Te quería preguntar si me puedes traer un ""te quiero""
Ey, un ""te quiero"" sincero
Porque sino, detente, detente
Ey, mírame bien de frente
Que se entere la gente que tú a mí me miente' (Yeah)
Tú a mí me miente', tú no ere' buena gente
No, no
Esto no es (No es)
No es amor (Ey)
Es un capricho (-pricho)
Con buen sabor (Ey)
Entiende que, y, entiende ya que te quiero, bebé, pero-"

Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies

Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Hey-ey-hey

See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
All the streets where once was pity

You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive

Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

I'll wait, I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait, my love is here, is here to stay
So lay your head on me
[Verse 3: Alex]
Little, do you know I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep?
Little, do you know all my mistakes are slowly drowning me?
Little, do you know I'm trying to make it better piece by piece?
Little do you know I, I love you 'til the sun dies?
[Chorus: Both,

Oh wait, just wait, I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait, I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait, our love is here, is here to stay
So lay your head on me"

Mamarre, mamarre, mamarre, mamarre
Cuando va pa' la disco, ella queda encendí'a
Llega con to'a las amigas
Ella baja downtown, si te pichea, estás out
Mientras rebota, ella dice que esa no
DJ, que le ponga una de Don (Que le ponga una de Don)
A ella le gusta el reggaetón-tón-tón-tón-tón
Que está suelta y que dejen la presión
¡Guaynaa!

Cómo lo mueve esa muchachota
Metiéndole al dembow es que se bota
Y yo postia'o aquí con esta nota
La miro y rebotan, rebotan, rebotan, rebota
Cómo lo mueve esa muchachita
Le mete al dembow y no se quita
Yo tengo el ritmo que la debilita
Ella tiene nalga y tetita, nalga y tetita

O que os olhos não veem o coração não sente
Eu tenho um jeito de amar bem diferente
O que você não vê é que as outras mentem
Eu tô dizendo a verdade na tua frente

Veja bem, não é maldade
É que tem tanto homem bonito na cidade
E eu tô na flor da idade
Melhor se arrepender do que passar vontade

Eu espero que você entenda
Que o meu amor é amor de quenga
Eu não quero que você se prenda
No meu amor (Meu amor), amor de quenga (Amor de quenga)

Ya dime si quieres estar conmigo o si mejor me voy
Tus besos dicen que tú sí me quieres pero tus palabras no
Y al chile, yo hasta moriría por ti pero dices que no
No eres directa, neta ya me estás cansando, sé concreta por favor
[Coro]
Y en la noche en que las estrellas salen
Yo pienso en ti mi amor
¿Qué me hiciste? De mi cabeza no sales
Y no lo digo por mamón
Si me dices para ti qué soy
No dudaré en hacerte tan feliz
Eres especial para mí
Dime por qué me haces sufrir
Yo te olvidaré desde las Fuentes de Ortiz
[Verso 2]
Soy inseguro cuando dices que me quieres porque creo que no
Como bebé caigo, pero sí redondito en tu trampa, amor
Y ya dime si tú me quieres, por favor
Ya he sufrido y me he empedado tanto por tu amor
[Coro]
Y en la noche en que las estrellas salen
Yo pienso en ti mi amor
¿Qué me hiciste? De mi cabeza no sales
Y no lo digo por mamón
Si me dices para ti qué soy
No dudaré en hacerte tan feliz
Eres especial para mí
Dime por qué me haces sufrir
Yo te olvidaré desde las Fuentes de Ortiz"

Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell

And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
[Verse 2]
Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me
[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright

338,Welcome to the Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,78,The Black Parade,2006-10-23,rock,311107,"[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it"
339,More Than a Feeling,Boston,78,Boston,1976,rock,285133,"[Verse 1]
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
[Post-Chorus]
I see my Marianne walkin' away
[Verse 2]
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky
[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
[Post-Chorus]
I see my Marianne walkin' away
[Instrumental Break 02:30-03:04]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, oh oh
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
But I'm here right now, right now
(Right now, right now)
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
(Right now, with you)
I don't even care
I’ll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright
[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention, oh
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby?
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said, ""Oel ngati kameie"""

Eu serei o seu amor, se você quiser que eu seja
Eu te seguiria para qualquer lugar
Diga alguma coisa, eu estou desistindo de você
E estou me sentindo tão pequeno
Isso estava dominando a minha cabeça
Eu não sei nada
E eu vou tropeçar e cair
Eu ainda estou aprendendo a amar
Apenas começando a engatinhar
Diga alguma coisa, eu estou desistindo de você
Sinto muito por não ter conseguido te alcançar
Qualquer lugar, eu teria te seguido
Diga alguma coisa, eu estou desistindo de você
E eu vou engolir meu orgulho
Você é a pessoa que eu amo
E eu estou dizendo adeus
Diga alguma coisa, eu estou desistindo de você
Lamento que eu não possa te alcançar
Qualquer lugar, eu teria te seguido
Diga alguma coisa, eu estou desistindo de você"

I'm devoted
[Verse 1: Kal Paseo]
Forever, we strong, timeless in the fabric
You don't like the way I spit? I apologize, it's a habit
At this point I'm a catalyst, generationally impactin'
I know for a fact that they'll copy my actions
In California or Seattle, no matter the battle, don't feature a beat?
I'll chop it again for competitors just to remind you this shit is too easy for me
And I get it, if you never seen it, I believe it
Everybody keep it underground and they repeat it
But I'm one to spread it out, discover, never be conceited
Or you end up makin' a ruckus, a prisoner and defeated
I'm the opposite of Heated Heavy, ever light up on the feet, they wonder when I'm breathin' or believin' I'm even incapable of defeating, I'm flippin' the beat, however, you think I wouldn't flip anything else, end up deleted
Recycling recyclers of lyricism, independence from the bottom of the barrel and it's livin' in 'em
Finna get rid of the bickerin' of it, the wickedest of the issue in 'em
Bitch, I don't want no bullshit when I'm provin' it, you will need my criticism
What I'm aimin' to change, your reaction to me in the dust
And I'm rakin' in bank, celebrate your passin' with a dub
What a hater would say? warrant a visit from the prince of blood
I sprang from the flames, not even a bit of luck
Similar to an orangutan, I'm sprintin' with tang, don't wanna put 'em under, but I must, if I don't, what affectin' the game?
Don't wanna give it the comin', the coper don't get what I got, but I cuff it, a given, I fuck it up and I'ma get it, but they gettin' broken, I'm workin' to open it, freakin', I've kind of been doper than God with the grace

Giuro l'altra notte è stato bello
Non  esci più dal mio cervello
Non  basterebbe un solo anello
Tu vali più di ogni gioiello

E  chissà se
Quando parti poi ritorni qui da me
E dimmi se
Questo sentimento vale anche per te
Balla  finché
Rimanendo ad occhi chiusi
Mi dai un bacio e poi ti scusi
Resta qui solo un secondo in più perché

Fino a quando sale sale il sole e perdi il conto delle ore

And I spend it on girls and shoes

""Notáveis visitantes da América Latina e de todo o mundo, combatentes das forças armadas do povo, trabalhadores: nós tivemos 14 horas e meio de desfile militar. (Cantando) Eu penso que só uma pessoa imbuída com entusiasmo infinito é capaz de resistir tais provas. De qualquer maneira, eu vou tentar ser o mais breve possível (Cantando).
Nós estamos muitos felizes em relação a essa atitude do povo. Eu acredito que hoje nós deveríamos esboçar um percurso para seguir, analisar um pouco o que nós fizemos até agora, e ver a que ponto da nossa história estamos, e o que temos adiante. Todos nós tivemos chance de ver o desfile militar. Talvez nós que estamos nessa plataforma poderíamos apreciar melhor do que você na praça, talvez até melhor do que os que desfilaram. Esse primeiro de maio nos diz muito, diz muito sobre o que a revolução vem sendo até agora, o que conquistou até agora; mas talvez não diga tanto a nós quanto diz para os nossos visitantes.
Nós temos sido testemunha, todos nós cubanos, de todos os passos dados pela revolução, então talvez não consigamos perceber o quanto avançamos tanto quanto os visitantes, particularmente aqueles visitantes da America Latina, que ainda hoje vivem em um mundo muito similar ao que vivíamos ontem. É como se fossem de repente transportados do passado para o presente da nossa revolução, com todo seu progresso extraordinário comparado ao passado. Nós não temos a intenção essa noite de enfatizar o mérito do que fizemos. Nós apenas queremos nos localizar o ponto no qual estamos no presente.
Hoje, nós tivemos a chance  de ver os resultados genuínos da revolução nesse primeiro de maio, diferentemente dos primeiro de maio anteriores. Antigamente essa data era a ocasião para cada categoria de trabalhadores para apresentarem suas demandas, suas aspirações em relação ao que poderia ser melhorado para homens que eram surdos para os interesses da classe trabalhadores, homens que não poderiam nem assentir em favor das demandas básicas porque eles não governavam para as pessoas, para os trabalhadores, para os camponeses, ou para os humildes; eles governaram somente para os privilegiados, o interesse econômico dominante. Fazer tudo pelo povo significava prejudicar os interesses que eles representavam e então eles não poderiam assentir para nenhuma demanda do povo. O desfile do primeiro de maio daqueles dias ficou marcado pelas reclamações e pelo protesto dos trabalhadores.
O quão diferente foi o desfile de hoje! O quão diferente até mesmo dos primeiros desfiles depois que a revolução triunfou. O desfile de hoje mostra o quanto avançamos. Os trabalhadores (alguns aplausos) agora não precisam se submeter a essas dificuldades; os trabalhadores agora não precisam implorar para executivos surdos; os trabalhadores agora não estão sujeitos a dominação de nenhuma classe exploradora; os trabalhadores não mais vivem em um país controlado por homens que servem interesses exploratórios. Os trabalhadores sabem agora que tudo que a revolução faz, tudo que o governo faz ou pode fazer, tem um objetivo: ajudar aos trabalhadores, ajudar as pessoas. (Aplausos)
Caso contrário, não haveria explicação para o sentimento espontâneo de apoio pelo Governo Revolucionário, essa simpatia transbordante que cada homem e mulher expressaram hoje ao passar em frente a tribuna (Aplausos).
E para onde quer que olhemos vemos já os frutos da Revolução, porque os primeiros que desfilaram no dia de hoje foram precisamente as crianças de cidade escolar “Camilo cienfuegos” (Aplausos). E  vimos desfilar os primeiros pioneiros (Aplausos) com um sorriso de esperança, confiança e carinho; vimos os jovens rebeldes desfilarem (Aplausos); vimos as mulheres da Federação desfilarem (Aplausos); vimos desfilar incontáveis escolas criadas pela Revolução (Aplausos); vimos desfilar estudantes de inseminação artificial (Aplausos) que, em número 1000 estudantes de 600 cooperativas de cana-de-açúcar estudam na capital da República (Aplausos); vimos humildes jovens do povo desfilar com seus uniformes dos centros escolares, onde estão se preparando para serem futuros representantes diplomáticos de nosso país no futuro (Aplausos); vimos os alunos das escolas que albergam a jovens camponeses da Ciénaga de Zapata, o lugar escolhido pelos mercenários para atacar nosso país (Aplausos); vimos desfilarem milhares de camponeses que estão estudando na capital, procedentes dos rincões mais longínquos de nossa ilha, das montanhas do Oriente ou das Villas, das cooperativas de cana-de-açúcar ou nas fazendas do povo (Aplausos); vimos as jovens que estudam para assistentes de círculos infantis (Aplausos).
E aqui cada um desses núcleos colegiais tem sido capaz de demonstrar atos que, se se considerar o brevíssimo tempo com que contaram para se preparar, são duplamente dignos de admiração e elogio (Aplausos). Vimos não somente o que vem do campo, temos visto também o que vai para o campo, porque aqui desfilaram os professores voluntários (Aplausos) e desfilaram também os representantes dos 100 mil jovens que já estão marchando até o interior da República para cumprir o plano de erradicar totalmente o analfabetismo em nosso país em uma ano (Aplausos). De onde vem essas forças e para onde vão? Vem do povo e vão para o povo (Aplausos).
Esses jovens são sim filhos do povo (Aplausos). Esses jovens sim são filhos do povo (Aplausos). E quando os víamos hoje escrever com suas formações “LVP”, ou a inscrição de: “Viva nossa Revolução socialista!” (Aplausos prolongados e exclamações: “Somos socialistas, para adiante, para adiante e o que não gosta que tome purgante!”), nós pensamos: que difícil teria sido tudo isso sem uma revolução!, que difícil que qualquer um dessas crianças da montanha tivessem desfilado por aqui hoje! Que difícil que qualquer um desses jovens do nosso campo, que qualquer jovenzinho ou jovenzinha de famílias mais humildes, que tivessem podido conhecer sequer a capital da República, estudar em qualquer uma dessas escolas, desfilar com alegria e o orgulho como desfilaram hoje, admirar a todos, admirar nossos visitantes, e humildes da cidade ou do campo (Aplausos), não foram jamais encontrar os camponeses das montanhas distantes, não foram jamais encontrar o jovem pobre branco ou negro de nossos campos ou de nossas cidades. (Aplausos); arte cultura, profissões universitárias, oportunidades na vida, honras, vestidos elegantes, foram um privilégio de uma insignificante minoria; minoria representada hoje, com essa graça e com esse humorismo com que hoje algumas federações de trabalhadores imitaram os ricos, desfilando em frente a essa tribuna com seus vestidos elegantes que caracterizavam aquela juventude das famílias abastadas (Exclamações de: “fora!”). É assombroso que no dia de hoje desfilaram mais de 20 mil esportistas e ginastas (Aplausos) e sim, se tem em conta que estamos apenas começando. E isto sem ir todavia ao mais maravilhoso que tivemos a oportunidade de contemplar hoje, que é esse povo  armado e esse povo unido que marcou presença neste 1° de maio (Aplausos prolongados).
E como seria possível sem uma revolução? E como é possível comparar esse presente com o anterior? E como é possível não se emocionar quando se vê marchar filas intermináveis de trabalhadores primeiro, esportistas depois e milicianos depois? E como às vezes marchavam confundidos, trabalhadores, atletas e milicianos, a pensar que no final das contas, trabalhadores, atletas e milicianos são a mesma coisa (Aplausos).
Se poderia explicar a qualquer um por que nosso povo tem que sair vitorioso de qualquer provação. Observamos as nutridíssimas mulheres nas filas das federações (Aplausos) e é que, simplesmente, os homens estavam nas unidades de artilharia, nos canhões, nos morteiros, nas baterias antiaéreas e nos batalhões de milícias que desfilaram depois; ao fim, essas mulheres eram as esposas, irmãs, mães e namoradas dos milicianos que depois marcharam nos batalhões (Aplausos). E possivelmente, essas jovens das escolas secundárias básicas, e esses filhos, esses jovens pioneiros que por aí desfilaram abrindo o desfile, ou que logo desfilaram com os atletas, eram simplesmente seus filhos (Aplausos).
E assim se pode apreciar tudo o que é hoje o povo humilde que luta pelos humildes: trabalhadores de todas as profissões, trabalhadores manuais e trabalhadores intelectuais. Marchando junto o escritor com o artista, o ator, o locutor; marchando juntos o médico com os enfermeiros e os empregados das clínicas; e marchando em grande número debaixo da bandeira do Sindicato Nacional dos Trabalhadores da Educação, os professores, os pedagogos, os empregados do Ministério da Educação.
E hoje mais que nunca tivemos a oportunidade de apreciar e compreender tudo que vale no nosso país, tudo o que produz no nosso país; podemos compreender melhor do que nunca que existem, ou haviam, duas classes de cidadãos: os cidadãos que trabalham. Os cidadãos que produziam e que criavam e os que viviam sem trabalhar nem produzir, os que viviam simplesmente como parasitas. (Aplausos)"

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I could taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

Or the moment of truth in your lies

Now dance, fucker, dance,
 
man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away
Take him out today
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me

How to say
How I feel

Are said too much
They're not enough

Welcome to the Waking Up podcast. This is Sam Harris. T
oday I’ll be speaking with a man whose work I greatly admire—Dan Carlin, the host of the
 
Hardcore History
 
and Common Sense podcasts—
and Dan and I will be releasing this conversation jointly on both of our podcasts. We’re calling this a “crosscast,” which is analogous to a crosspost one sometimes sees on blogs that publish content simultaneously. It turns out we have many listeners in common, and many of you have been urging us to have a conversation, I think anticipating considerable disagreement on issues like the War on Terror, state security, and foreign policy. I don’t know that we collided as much as anyone might have expected, but we’ve had a good, energetic conversation, which I greatly enjoyed and I hope you will too. So in a moment, I give you Dan Carlin…
SH: Hey, Dan, how are you doing?
DC: I’m good, how are you?
SH: I’m great. Well, listen, as my listeners know, I have been frequently referring to you as the greatest history professor on earth, and I know this may cause you to blush, but I am just a huge fan of your Hardcore History podcast and have been recommending it to anyone with ears at this point.
DC: That is very dirty pool to start off a discussion with a compliment like that, because now what am I supposed to say? You said some of the nicest things, and I really appreciate them, thank you so much. Listen, isn’t it amazing we’re having these kinds of public discussions in the virtual realm here where everyone gets to watch? Modern technology has taken us back almost to an Athens-type situation, where we can have these sorts of public conversations and we don’t require some TV network to figure out if they can sell airtime or whatever for something like that. It’s a pretty interesting new world.
SH: Yeah, and I do not say this to preempt any criticism—
DC: Which always comes from me. That’s what I’m going to do.
SH: Actually, this was a question I wanted to ask you. You refer to yourself as “a fan of history,” and you are at pains to distinguish yourself from a professional historian or the legions thereof who may, in fact, be listening to your show and scrutinizing it for errors. Do you get pushback from academics? What’s that experience like for you?
DC: Well, I have to be honest. My own opinion here, but I think everyone’s been remarkably generous and nice to me on everything, because I had envisioned a completely different type of program when we started it. I wasn’t going to talk about any sort of narrative history at all. I was just going to talk about “Isn’t this weird?” and “Isn’t this funny?” and stuff history majors used to talk about on their lunch break. As the show evolved, the audience wanted more of the background, and so it went into territory I had never given a lot of thought to. You know, “Do I want to go challenge historians?” or something like that. This is why we use so many quotes and whatnot during the program, because I think, coming from the position that you know you’re not an expert, you’re not pretending to be an expert, when you make some sort of statement, we feel like you want “audio footnotes.” You want to say, “Listen, it’s not me saying this—here’s a couple of historical points of view.” You’re still picking and choosing, so it’s not totally fair, but I think I build that into the way we do things. If I was a professional historian with all the credentials and published all this, I would approach the program differently. Because I’m not, I try to make sure that every time we say something, we have somebody who is credible and trustworthy—or at least someone we should listen to a little bit more than the podcast host—back up what I’m saying. It’s become a key way that the show has evolved.
SH: Well, I wonder how deep that caveat actually cuts, because in my career, I have weighed in on many questions that fall outside the official area of my academic expertise, and occasionally I get pushback on this very point, that I don’t have a credential that would cause someone to be confident about my opinions in this area—let’s say on the topic of religion. But many of these subjects simply require that one read the books and be attentive to one’s sources and have conversations with experts. And at a certain point you’re playing the same language game the experts are. It’s certainly appropriate to have humility and be attentive to the frontiers of one’s ignorance, but in science this really breaks down quite starkly, because I’m surrounded by scientists who simply do not have the academic bona fides you would expect, and yet they are contributing in various areas of science at the highest level. There are physicists who don’t have Ph.D.s in physics; there are computer scientists who don’t have even college degrees. I am in dialogue now with an expert on artificial intelligence who never went to high school, so at a certain point it’s a matter of how you can function in a given domain, not a matter of what your CV looks like. And scientists, as long as you’re making sense, accept this far more readily, in my experience, than people in the humanities. I’m wondering how you view this, because unless you’re making mistakes and not correcting them, I don’t see how you’re not functioning as an expert on those topics you touch. Maybe if you want to be an expert on World War II, or at least the Nazi side of it, you need to deal with primary sources in German, and that’s some wrinkle there. But I’m just wondering how you see that.
DC: I think it sort of depends on the specialty we’re talking about. For example, take a surgeon who operates on people’s brains. I think we can agree that you’re not going to want your amateur brain surgeon coming in and saying, “Listen, I read this expert, and this is how he suggests we do it.” There’s a specific specialty there. I think bringing up the humanities, though, is a wonderful point, because the humanities by their very nature are all things with much more leeway than you get in something like brain surgery, for example. Look at the subjects that make up the humanities: law, religion, language, arts, music. I think the way to put it would be that you were just suggesting that people outside the expertise have something, perhaps, that they can bring to the table. In a lot of these cases, I think it three-dimensionalizes things a little bit to have somebody from another discipline apply the mode of thinking common in their discipline to an unusual realm—in other words, get a 360° view of things.Take a historical event. You might want to have the Second World War examined by somebody who’s an expert in military affairs. Obviously, somebody who’s an expert in international relations is going to write a book with a different point of view. One of the best books I ever read on the Second World War was done by an economist who looked at it from a completely different point of view. So in that sense, I think you can three-dimensionalize reality, and that’s what you’re doing when you look at history—you’re looking at a moment in reality, and there are multiple Rashomons, a variety of ways to look at things. What I maybe bring to the table is, I’m looking at this from outside the specialty. You know, when you deal with a lot of historians today, you are dealing with scientists in a certain realm. These are people who aren’t going to talk about things that they can’t quantify. Any good scientist is going to want to be able to back up what they say in a peer-reviewed journal. That’s how a lot of historians are today. But the specialty they study takes away that ability to look at things from a farther-away lens. So fifty years ago you would’ve had all these historians who would’ve been just fine looking at events as though they were in a satellite and giving you these big pronouncements. Most historians today wouldn’t be comfortable with that. The problem is, historians aren’t dealing with brain surgery, they’re dealing with human beings. That by its very nature is hard to quantify and hard to get your mind around. So I guess it gives me a lot more leeway than a brain surgeon. And they’ve been very kind to me, all these professionals. I think they sometimes don’t like the way I dramatize events, but I look at this like what Alfred Hitchcock famously said about drama: Drama is just reality with the boring bits taken out. That’s kind of how I look at the history show. I’m giving you the story that an author would give you or a writer would give you or a historian fifty years ago might give you.
SH: Well, what you’re doing is fantastic, and that will be my last dollop of praise before we get into areas of controversy."

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
I quit school and that's what I did"

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this
Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began?
Will you release me with a kiss?
[Chorus]
I never took that pill against my will
There was a void I had to fill
You I thought would understand
That there's nothing in this world that's coming first
The only road I know is curved
But I keep walking straight ahead
[Verse 2]
Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight
Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night
[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hate to leave you bare
If you need me, I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down
Dazed by careless words
Cozy in my mind"

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
[Pre-Chorus]
Up on that hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
[Chorus]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See, Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now

I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be
You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound
[Chorus]
We're safe and sound
[Verse 2]
I could fill your cup
You know my river won't evaporate
This world we still appreciate
You could be my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns
I know that we'll be safe and sound
[Chorus]
(Safe and sound)
We're safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
We're safe and sound
(Hold your ground)
We're safe and sound
(Safe and sound)"

I close my eyes
Only for a moment and the moment's gone
All my dreams
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity
[Refrain]
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind
[Verse 2]
Same old song
Just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do
Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
[Refrain]
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
[Bridge]
Ohh-oh-ah
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Now, don't hang on
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy"

Maxo Kream - Roaches"
432,A Horse with No Name,America,77,America,1972,rock,252240,"[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot
 and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told was of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead"
433,You Make My Dreams,Daryl Hall & John Oates,77,Voices,1980,rock,190627,"[Verse 1]
What I want
You've got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got
Full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together
And, uh, how? I can't explain
[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you)
Well, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, yeah, you make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you) Well, yeah
[Verse 2]
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I, I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same
[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) Mm-hmm
You make my dreams come true
Oh, yeah (You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you)
Well, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) Ooh-ooh
You make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you) Oh, yeah
Well, listen to this
Ow"
434,Dynamite,Taio Cruz,77,The Rokstarr Hits Collection,2010-01-01,pop,202613,"[Verse 1]
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (Yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (Yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (Yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on, yeah
[Chorus]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Sayin' ""Ayo, gotta let go""
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Sayin' ""Ayo, baby, let's go""
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite"
435,Halo,Beyoncé,77,I AM...SASHA FIERCE,2008-11-14,r&b,261640,"[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't ever gonna shut you out
[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away"
436,You & Me,James TW,77,Chapters,2019-04-26,r&b,231653,"[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to hurt you
So why’d I let you walk out the door?
You say that you don't know me
You don't know who I am anymore
But if you knew the truth, then
Then you wouldn’t feel insecure
'Cause if I didn't have you
I wouldn't have nothing at all
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes
I always forget that you can't read my mind
[Chorus]
As long as I got you and me
Moving through this world as a two-man team
I'll always have everything I need
You don't even realise what you mean
No one could fall for you quite like me
No one could get me so perfectly
You don't even realise (Oh-oh-oh)
You’re all that I need
’Cause I want you and me, you and me
[Verse 2]
I know one day we'll look back
Stories on the tip of our tongues
A library full of pages
Remembering when we fell in love
All of the broken hearts and the stupid mistakes
Have got us to where we are, it was worth all the pain
Yeah, we’ll look back
We'll look back and laugh"
437,Ahora Te Puedes Marchar,Luis Miguel,77,Soy Como Quiero Ser,1987-07-15,latin,191973,"[Letra de ""Ahora Te Puedes Marchar""]
[Verso]
Si tú me hubieras dicho siempre la verdad
Si hubieras respondido cuando te llamé
Si hubieras amado cuando te amé
Serías en mis sueños la mejor mujer
Si no supiste amar
Ahora te puedes marchar
Si tú supieras lo que yo sufrí por ti
Teniendo que olvidarte sin saber por qué
Y ahora me llamas, me quieres ver
Me juras que has cambiado y piensas en volver
Si no supiste amar
Ahora te puedes marchar
[Pre-Coro]
Aléjate de mí
No hay nada más que hablar
Contigo, yo perdí
Ya tengo con quién ganar
[Interludio Instrumental]
[Coro]
Ya sé que no hubo nadie que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso, comprendo que estas aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar
Ahora te puedes marchar"

Ella se resignó y no lo quiere ni ver
Se creyó que iba a ganar y le tocó perder"

Scheiß' auf deine Maßstäbe und deinen Klunker

Dass ich mehr bin als nur ein Gerücht
Oder ein Lied auf deinem Computer
Da ist mehr als die Leute wissen

Manchmal bin ich blank, manchmal bin ich reich
Manchmal bin ich nett, manchmal kann ich eine Schlampe sein
Manchmal bin ich stark, manchmal gebe ich auf
Ich zeige es nicht, aber ich habe schon viel scheiße erlebt

Will you end my pain? Will you take my life?

[Dialogue]
Most people are searching for happiness. They're looking for it. They're trying to find it in someone or something outside of themselves. That's a fundamental mistake. Happiness is something that you are and it comes from the way you think
[Verse]
Can you break my bones? Will you tear my skin?
Can you taste my lust? Can you feel my sin?
See, I'm a waste of life, I should just kill myself
Yeah, I could slit my wrists, but it really wouldn't help
Wouldn't fix my issues or change your mind
'Cause I broke your heart and you buried mine
Now I'm six-feet deep and I can't breathe
I got dirt in my eyes and blood on my sleeves
But I dig my way up through these roots and leaves
So, I can get some air, so, I can finally breathe
And now I'm on my knees, oh, baby, begging please
Will you?
 Will you?"

They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?"

Vedi il gruppo ancora lì, mi rifarò (

A-assegni in bianco, soldi in nero (

Sono in gioco per il dinero
Vestito di nero, tu, scemo, fuma di meno (Uh)
Scendiamo dal mezzo, portiere toccano il cielo (Cielo)
Scrivimi in privato, ma tanto sai che non leggo (Ah)
Sto sopra un privato, no scalo, dritto in albergo (Brr, brr)
Ah, Shiva mi aspetta di sotto
Blocco mezza via, lo passo a prendere in i8 (Skrrt, skrrt)
Fumo mentre guido, questo joint è troppo grosso (Skrrt, skrrt)
A 190, non vedo il posto di blocco

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?
[Chorus: Zac Efron]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight
[Verse 2: Zendaya]
You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all"

Bringing evil to your residents like da tyrant
Flip my lid pressurized flow like a hydrant so that makes me suited for the hose

she's sliding down the pole
And that should be the Headline, cuz thats something they know
Keep the opposition's vision obsolete therefore thats OVO
Triangulate my position from using spokeo

I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete
[Refrain]
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
[Verse 2]
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?"

Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? 
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

'Cause mi sueño no se ha hecho una realidad
Pero el tiempo dirá, el tiempo dirá
If we go spend our lives together lo que el mundo gira

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach

The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of"

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day
[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day..."

503,In The Air Tonight - 2015 Remastered,Phil Collins,76,Face Value (Deluxe Editon),1981-01-01,rock,336453,"[Round 1: Soul Khan]
See back then, the goal was musical buzz
""What? You're saying you're above battle rap?""
No, you dumb motherfuckers, I never said that
I just had to pursue what I love
If that's something you view as a snub, that's a you problem
These rounds, Diz you really got a Jew problem
Megaton better come with a new nuke on 'em
Throat sores, so I'm goin' Michael Jordan with the flu on 'em
Am I better than this? No
But I'm better than you
Not as a battler, listen, I'ma say this
Not necessarily not as a battler, but as a person, that's what the evidence proves
When I present it to you
You might pretend it's a ruse
And I intend to confuse
You know what they say about those treacherous Jews
I have a question for you
Saw you vs Iron
Shit's brilliant
But now that this Jew got next, tell me
How many Jew jokes have you got left?
Hold on, let me guess; six million?
But let me get back, to reflectin' and building on all that it happened
Since I left the field like I was Dr. Manhattan
I was living off of my rapping
'till I tied the knot, then I got into a tighter spot
Then I had to find a job
But
Wait, sorry fuck
So Diz', a job is a place where you go to make money
Like an office or store
You ever seen 
The Office
 before?
It's like that, but less funny
And then you get a check
You can spend it on your food and ya rent
Fuck, I'm doing it again
So Diz', rent...
I'll take it slow
See rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly
See, I ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s
So according to you, right, on Twitter you called me a ""manchild""
The audacity!
That you, mister level headed adult
YOU called me a ""manchild"" that is damn wild
You were living with your mom and dad while
I was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on QP for that damn file
Back to that Iron battle, you know I gotta say
The angle about Jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever
Except you didn't go to work on 9-- ever
See down the line I went through shit
My crew split
As too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip
And my momma got too sick
Down to a toothpick
And I stopped makin' music
See the sad thing is Diz, you said I tried and I flopped
Nah, it was going fine, then I stopped
It was painful, truly
See, I know it sounds sad, 
but Soul is still a 
Joker
 though
I ain't talking about the Gotham kind
Talking like Persona 5
That is what I was personified
Cause I lost track of all the kind of monsters I had caught inside
Especially the one whisperin' to me that I oughta die
So bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me
That is more evil than the shit I used to tell myself all the time
I got out that coma I been frozen lately
I gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me
Even though the road was shaky
Like the way Dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby
So now y'all here to see my return to the format
You here to be my personal doormat
Hold up
Before we go all that
Do battle rappers still say dumb shit like ""you catch a shell, then you sleep like Squirtle and Snorlax""?
No, good
Well ignore that, fantastic
You know, I respect you Diz, because you're willing to give someone the shirt off your back
Even when they didn't need it, or were asking you for that
He takes his shirt off all the time
And I know you like to make fun of the way I make apologies
Lot of liberals are faker than astrology
I'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist, and the difference is tremendous
And there's one thing I have to say, it's gotta be legit
I am sorry, for every bomb that Israel has ever launched at Lebanon
They always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong
The IDF level houses, you know, bring fiery death on thousands
Maybe someone you knew
Nah I ain't pushing no button, but, Israeli government always said they do it in the name of the Jews
This ain't a angle or a gimmick, fuck the haters and the cynics
But I refuse to accept that any Jew is protected by doing something so fuckin' hateful to you
On top of all that
And all the while, the West Bank has gotten terrorized
Every day in Gaza's genocide
And America could end it by threatening to ends its ties
But they just always defend it
And the Palestinians get left to die
At this point, Diz probably thinkin'
This ain't therapy
Diz, that ain't fair to me
Because I gotta grapple in my disgrace
And my old battles are like your face, they've aged terribly
And to everybody, to all you who suggested; ""No SJW stuff""
I've reviewed your request, and, shut the fuck up!
I know they hate it when I do this, but sorry, I'm accountable
So, I am sorry if I have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that I'd use
Especially cause it doesn't reflect my personal views
I fucked up so much
And that's being accountable
Being a fuckin' shithead is not a fuckin' alpha move
And it's like fuckin', and I'm not talkin' about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full"
504,This City,Sam Fischer,76,This City,2019-12-13,r&b,194853,"[Verse 1]
I've been seeing lonely people in crowded rooms
Covering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos
It's all about smoke screens and cigarettes
Looking through low lights at silhouettes
But all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms
[Chorus]
This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasing stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart, oh
[Verse 2]
I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt
And I remember nights when art didn't feel like work
She wakes up at noon and she's out 'til three
She leaves her perfume all over me
But I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt
[Chorus]
Oh, this city's gonna break my heart (It's gonna break my heart)
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasing stars (It's got me chasing stars)
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home (Oh)
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart"

506,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - Mono Version,The Rolling Stones,76,Out Of Our Heads,1965-07-30,rock,222813,"IN THE LONG PROCESS OF EDITING
A Christmas book entitled ""ELF"" sits on a table, a drawing of 6'2"" BUDDY THE ELF (the guy we've seen from all the trailers and posters) is on the cover.
We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen. PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.
PAPA ELF
So you're here for the story? Okay. Just let me wet my whistle.
He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.
PAPA ELF
(like it's liquor)
Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent! Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you? Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know. For instance, we can't tell a lie. It's physiologically impossible. Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf. You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.
QUICK CUT AWAY TO
Two ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of ""Hot Cobbler"" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.
DISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF
Lazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...
EXT. ELF TREE - DAY
The exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
...you can bake cookies in a tree. But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...
We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
PAPA ELF
But the third job. Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile. Some call it ""the show"" or the ""big dance"". It's the profession every Elf aspires to. And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.
CUT TO:
A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP
The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything. There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.
PAPA ELF
It's a job only an Elf can do. Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building. They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.
CUT AWAY:
1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table. 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.
PAPA ELF
And no human could ever do this work. Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked. In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop. That is until about thirty years ago. And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story. It was back in 1968. A particularly successful Christmas...
INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
A Christmas tree flickers. A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.
NURSE
You're quite a giggler, aren't you?
(lying him down)
Well, it's time for night-night.
She tucks the baby in and exits.
NURSE
(as she leaves)
Merry Christmas, my angel.
CLOSE ON
The Rocking Crib. The BABY rises, giggling. His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.
Santa's black boots drop in from the chimney. The baby shakes the gate. Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents. There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG! Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib. The gate is down:
BABY'S POV
He gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.
FADE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP
A bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas. Several elves start CHANTING for a speech. SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause. Merrily, he gestures for quiet.
SANTA
Alright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year. Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...
A party HORN blows. LAUGHTER. Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.
SANTA
And now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!
Santa looks at his watch as five seconds click off. The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.
SANTA
Alright! Vacation's over! Back to work! Time to start preparations for next Christmas.
The elves cheer and get back to work. When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.
SANTA
What in the name of Sam Hill...?
More COOING. Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.
Silence. The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor. An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name ""Little Buddy Diapers"".
ELF TWIN #2
It's name is Buddy. He must've...
ELF TWIN #1
...snuck into your sack at the orphanage. What do we do, Santa?
Santa looks befuddled.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Santa had a decision to make. But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over. So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down. Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father. My, how I love that boy.
MONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF
A giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.
Super 8 home movie of Papa Elf holding a two-year old baby that is almost as big as he is.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Tough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves. I mean, not really...
Video Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.
A series of Polaroid photos showing Buddy, 12, dunking a basketball over three elves.
Buddy in Elf school, wedged in a tiny desk. The ELF TEACHER is pointing to the black board where ""THE CODE OF ELVES"" is written.
ELF TEACHER
And before we learn how to build the latest in extreme graphic chipset processors, let's recite the Code of the Elves, shall we? Number one?
ELF STUDENTS
TREAT EVERY DAY LIKE CHRISTMAS!
ELF TEACHER
Number two?
ELF STUDENTS
THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE ON THE NICE LIST!
ELF TEACHER
Number three?
We push in on Buddy as he recites...
BUDDY & EVERYONE
THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER IS SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR!
EXT. ELF HOCKEY POND - CURRENT DAY - DAY
An ANNOUNCER ELF is on a megahorn, doing play by play of an elf hockey team...
ANNOUNCER
(on megaphone)
Lum Lum across the line, feeds it to Foom Foom, behind the net, looking, feeds Blinky...Wait! Rimpo-correction, Wombo. I think...and - uh-oh! - here comes BUDDY!
QUICK CUTS
A smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force. The elves are helpless. Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.
ANNOUNCER
(like an elf Pat Foley)
He SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES! And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.
INT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Post game, Buddy's in the locker room. Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.
POM POM
Good game, Buddy.
BUDDY
Thanks! Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!
POM POM
No sweat. It's just a collar bone!
They're all tossing their jock straps in the bin. Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray. It's Buddy's.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
But as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.
RAPID FIRE:
A dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets. These shots look shockingly painful.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens! Sone of a nutcracker!
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
The FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.
But Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.
The elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.
Pom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
We see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers. We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.
BUDDY
Gee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming. I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.
ELF SUPERVISOR
It's okay, Buddy. How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?
Buddy is about to answer. But then his face winces up. FIGHTING BACK TEARS.
ELF SUPERVISOR
How many, Buddy? It's okay, you can tell me.
Clearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.
BUDDY
I only made...
(crying)
Eighty-five.
Eighty-five? He might as well have said zero. The elves all look at each other.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, don't worry about it Buddy. This is a great start! You're only 915 off pace.
BUDDY
Oh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?! I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world! I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins! We all have different talents, that's all.
BUDDY
Actually, it seems like everyone has the same talents. Except for me.
ELF SUPERVISOR
That's not true, you have lots of talents. Special talents. Like, uh...
Supervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up. They try to chime in.
ELF #1
You changed the batteries in the fire alarm!
ELF #2
(absurdly positive)
You sure did! Triple A's! And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again! Won't he!
(everyone agrees)
ELF #3
And you're the only baritone in the Elf choir. Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!
ELF #1
In a good way!
ELF SUPERVISOR
See? You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins. You're Ex-traordinary!
BUDDY
Well, you know what? I'm sick of being extraordinary!
Upset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Buddy storms into his tiny house. Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised. Buddy can't speak. He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.
INT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
This bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini. The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup. Buddy sits on it and starts to sob. Washing his face in the tiny sink.
KNOCK KNOCK.
We INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.
PAPA ELF
Son? Are you okay?
BUDDY
Go away!
PAPA ELF
(shocked)
Buddy!
BUDDY
I'm sorry, papa. May I please have some Buddy time?
PAPA ELF
Open up, son. I think we need to talk.
The door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room. He wiggles out. Still wiggling.
PAPA ELF
Come sit with your papa.
Papa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee. Papa winces.
PAPA ELF
Alright, let's hear it.
BUDDY
Well, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker. And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you. And great Grandpapa before ye. I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.
PAPA ELF
Well, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy. And it's long over due...
(intense beat)
You see...um...
BUDDY
What is it, Papa?
Papa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes. He can't bring himself to do it.
PAPA ELF
(changing the subject)
I need your help on something.
(adjusting Buddy's weight)
Up up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.
Papa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.
SANTA'S SLEIGH
A GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.
BUDDY
Wow. Santa's sleigh!
(hesitates)
Can I touch it?
PAPA ELF
Touch it? You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.
BUDDY
I thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.
PAPA ELF
And where do the reindeers get their magic from?
BUDDY
Christmas spirit. Everyone knows that.
PAPA ELF
Yes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
PAPA ELF
(hard to break the news)
Well, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.
BUDDY
(shocked)
What? Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?
PAPA ELF
There's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.
BUDDY
That's ridiculous! There's no way parents could do that all in one night! And what about Santa's cookies!? I suppose parents eat them too?
PAPA ELF
I know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands. See how low the Claus-o-meter is?
We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.
PAPA ELF
That's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.
Papa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir. Buddy is amazed.
BUDDY
Oh my Gosh!
PAPA ELF
Watch the language son.
BUDDY
Forgive me, Papa. What's that?
PAPA ELF
A Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.
(off Buddy's look)
I know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?
(around him)
Listen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle. Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?
BUDDY
(coming around)
Do I?!
And just like that, father and son hunker down and tinker together.

We push past a tiny door marked TESTING. Elves everywhere are testing toys. Buddy stands in front of a conveyor belt pushing Jack in the Boxes past him. He turns the crank producing the 'POP GOES THE WEASEL' tune and a puppet pops out scaring him every time. POP!
BUDDY
Ahh!
Another one: POP!
BUDDY
UHHHH!
This one doesn't pop for a beat and then: POP!
BUDDY
(biggest one yet)
AHHHH!!
(to supervisor)
I'm going to take five, okay Krumpet?
KRUMPET
Okay!
We follow Buddy as he approaches an Elf kitchenette. But before he enters, he stops, over-hearing a few Elves drinking cider and talking behind his back.
FOOM FOOM
...and that EX-traordinary bit! That was quick thinking.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Hey, I feel bad for the guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.
FOOM FOOM
Hey, he's believed he was a real Elf for this long, hasn't he?
WE SLAM INTO A CLOSE UP OF BUDDY'S SHOCKED FACE
QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS FROM BUDDY'S PAST flash before his eyes not unlike 'the sixth sense'.
AT THE SHOEMAKER: Buddy is painfully squeezing into new shoes.
IN BED: Buddy tosses and turns - three beds have been pushed together to make a human twin-sized bed.
IN THE ELF SHOWERS: Buddy is struggling to wash under a three-foot high shower head.
THE ELF CHOIR PHOTO: Only Buddy's waist is visible, he's cropped out.
An exact replay of those rapid-fire shots of Buddy slamming his head into doorways, beams, cabinets.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles...Dickens! Sone of a Nutcracker!
IN THE FACTORY: tinkering with a Ken Doll, Buddy moves the arms like his arms.
BACK ON BUDDY, queasy. His head spins as the CAMERA CIRCLES HIM. The room spins. Buddy's knees go weak.
Pom Pom hurries over, concerned.
POM POM
You don't look so good, Buddy. Are you okay?
Buddy tries to speak, but instead COLLAPSES RIGHT ON TOP OF POM POM, crushing him beneath his weight.
POM POM
(muffled under Buddy)
I'm okay, Buddy. Don't worry about a thing. I'm warm.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER
Buddy wakes up from his sleep to find himself in Papa's workshop. FOCUS RACKS to Papa tending to his son.
BUDDY
Ooooooh. I had a terrible nightmare.
PAPA ELF
What is it, Buddy?
BUDDY
I dreamt I wasn't an Elf at all. I was a human. Oh, it was awful. I'm not a human, am I Papa?
PAPA ELF
I knew this day would come. You see, Buddy, I love you and nothing can ever change that. But the fact is, it wasn't a dream. You're not like the rest of us.
BUDDY
You mean I'm not an Elf?
PAPA ELF
No, son, you're a human being.
BUDDY
No wonder I'm always freezing!
PAPA ELF
We decided it was best to let you think you were one of us.
BUDDY
But I thought elves can't lie.
PAPA ELF
We can't. But Buddy, you never asked! I thought for sure when you cracked six feet it would come up.
BUDDY
(getting upset)
I thought I had a glandular problem.
PAPA ELF
Your glands are fine.
BUDDY
(emotional)
So, you're not my Papa?
PAPA ELF
Oh, I'll always be your Papa. It's just you have another Papa, too. A biological Papa.
Papa Elf opens a drawer and shows Buddy a photo: a young couple are in love...
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
I then proceeded to tell Buddy of how his father had fallen in love when he was very young with a beautiful girl named Susan Welles, and how Buddy was born and put up for adoption by his mother. And how she had later passed away. I told him his father had never even known Buddy was born. And most importantly, I told him where his Dad was: in a magical land called New York City.
Papa Elf puts a snow globe in front of Buddy showing the Empire State Building with a sign NEW YORK CITY.
BUDDY
Uhh! I feel confused and sweaty! I need some Buddy time!
Buddy runs off.
PAPA ELF
Buddy?! Buddy?!!
EXT. NORTH POLE - MINUTES LATER
Buddy runs and runs. He passes some ANIMATED ANIMALS, a RABBIT, a RACCOON and a SQUIRREL.
RACCOON
Hey, Buddy! Want to sing and pick snow berries?
BUDDY
Not now Pipsy!!
He passes by an ANIMATED SNOWMAN in the front yard of a toasty little cottage.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(a faint whisper)
Oooohhh! Buddy...
BUDDY
Hi, Jim. What's wrong?
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(very quietly)
Uh, ow. Sorry...my back's out of line again. Do you mind cracking it for me again?
BUDDY
Sure, Jim.
Buddy comes from behind him, squeezes and then we hear a CRACK.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(speaking at full volume)
Ohhh, thank you, Buddy. That's soooo good. It's from all the standing. They never build me sitting down. Hey? Why the long face?
BUDDY
Well, Jim. It seems I'm...I'm not an Elf.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Of course you're not. You're six-three and had a beard when you were fifteen.
BUDDY
Papa says my real father is living in a magical place far away.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
At least you have a father. I was just rolled up one day. I never had anyone to play catch with. And even if I did. I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I guess I am pretty lucky after all.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
I bet your dad would be so happy to see you, he'd hug you and never let go. I wish I had a dad to hug. And even if I did, I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I understand about your arms, Jim.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Well, you should do all the things I can't. Go see him. Hug him. And play catch. And scratch your ass.
BUDDY
I will. I'm gonna go find my dad!
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY
A triumphant swell of music as Buddy walks through the workshop for the last time. Each Elf he passes says goodbye.
BUDDY
Bye Choo-choo! Bye Sunshine! Bye Tinkle Winkle! By Puffy! Bye Flade! Bye Gayle!
Santa steps into frame and puts his arm around Buddy.
SANTA
So I hear you're going on a little journey to the big city?
BUDDY
Yeah, but I'm kind of nervous. Jim told me New York is really different.
SANTA
Don't listen to Jim. He's never been anywhere. He doesn't even have any feet. I've been to New York thousands of times.
BUDDY
Wow. What's it like?
SANTA
Well there's some things you should know: first off, if you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not free candy. Second, there are like thirty Ray's Pizzas and they all say they're the original, but the real one's on eleventh. And if you see a sign for a Peep show, it doesn't mean they're letting you look at presents before Christmas.
BUDDY
So much to remember...
SANTA
Don't worry, something tells me this trip is going to be good for you.
(patting him on the back)
It's time for my Buddy here to spread his wings.
BUDDY
I can't wait! Me and Dad are gonna go ice-skating and eat sugarplums!
SANTA
That's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. You see, Buddy, your father... Well he's on the naughty list.
FAST PUSH INTO:
The NAUGHTY LIST, landing on ""Walter Hobbs.""
BUDDY
NOOOOOO!!!!
SANTA
I'm sorry, but it's true.
BUDDY
My stomach hurts. It feels like evil.
SANTA
Listen, Buddy, some people. They get mixed up about what's important in life. But that doesn't mean they can't change. Maybe your dad just needs a little Christmas spirit!
BUDDY
I'm good at that!
SANTA
I know you are.
Papa Elf steps forward, trying to hide the fact that he's tearing up. He and Buddy embrace.
PAPA ELF
I love you, Buddy. And I'll always be here for you.
(crying)
Now go on, get!
BUDDY
(crying)
Yes, Papa.
(crying and skipping)
Bye guys. I'll miss you. I really will.
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Animals wave as Buddy heads off into the unknown.
ANIMALS
Bye, Buddy.
BUDDY
Bye lovable woodland animals!
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Buddy sits on an ice flow. He drifts along the cold sea through a haze, transitioning from the MAGIC LAND of the north pole to the REAL WORLD.
EXT. SNOW FIELD - DAY
Buddy trudges through a massive snow field. Each step he takes goes down five feet deep, we DISSOLVE to a series of scenes showing this epic struggle. He wears a beard of ice.
Exhausted, Buddy considers leaving himself for dead, but uses his last ounce of strength to pull out the old PHOTO of his father, WALTER HOBBS.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MEANWHILE
A large children's storybook publishing company. LARGE-SIZED book covers line the wall. ""Max the Big Blue Cat"", ""The Adventures of Rabbit Gang & Pop"", etc. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.
A huge corner office says 'WALTER HOBBS, EDITOR.'
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - DAY
Walter is the guy from Buddy's picture, only he looks a little older and a little meaner.
A NUN stands in front of Walter's large desk.
NUN
You're taking the books back?
WALTER
Hey, you're the one who's behind on the payments, don't try to make me out to be the bad guy here.
NUN
We're trying to get yo the money, but it's been difficult to raise the funding...the children are sponsoring another bake sale next month. That should help.
WALTER
See, there's your problem. You can't expect a bake sale to make solid cash these days. Places like Dunkin' Donuts and Cinnibon are expanding their product base with alternative breakfast and desert items. Even Starbucks carries baked goods. You guys really need to start thinking out of the box.
(out window; to NYC)
It's called capitalism, Miss Peters. If you can't stand the heat, move to Canada.
NUN
(begging)
The kids really love the books.
WALTER
You don't need to tell me that, I made them. I'm the one who ran the focus groups.
DEB, the secretary, pokes her head in.
DEB
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
Would you please use the intercom? We talked about this.
DEB
Do you want me to use it now? I mean, I already told you.
Walter purposefully ignores her. Deb leaves frame and now we hear her on the intercom.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
(hitting button)
Got it.
(to Nun, compassionate)
Tell you what, I know how much these books mean to your kids over there...
(beat)
I'll give you a three-week extension.
NUN
(sarcastic)
Bless your heart.
WALTER
(too busy to hear)
If I were you, I'd stay away from perishable goods. Think consumer services. That's hot right now.
EXT. CANADA - DAY
Buddy is half-way there. He's now clearly in the real world. He walks through a choppy, muddy, snowy terrain past a rusted propane tank. A REAL LIVE RACCOON crosses his path. Buddy acts like it's a cartoon.
BUDDY
Heyyyy. What's your name? I'm Buddy!
Buddy corners the raccoon, trapping it. Trying to be nice. IT hisses like crazy. But Buddy is undeterred.
BUDDY
Sounds like someone needs a hug!
He lunges forward. Like lightning, the raccoon BITES Buddy in the face.
BUDDY
NUT CRACKERS!!!
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Buddy walks along the Highway, looks up, then stops in his tracks.
REVEAL: A sign that says NEW YORK CITY/LINCOLN TUNNEL. His eyes light up.
EXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING
We see Buddy timidly inch his way through the Lincoln Tunnel along the walkway, pressed up against the wall while traffic roars by. Like a stray cat, Buddy dodges through traffic. His feelings of wonder are starting to be replaced with fear. He exits to the sight of the towering skyline of New York City with the sun breaking over it. He sees the Empire State Building, then looks at his snow globe.
BUDDY
Whoa...
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is caught up in the rhythms of the street and begins noticing the mundane details of this new world with amazement: traffic lights. Steam. Scaffolding.
WIDE SHOT
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy attempts to greet a sea of people, but New Yorkers ignore the guy in the Elf suit.
BUDDY
Hi.
(no response; next person)
Happy afternoon!
(no response; next person)
Salutations!
-- A woman tries to hail A cab. Buddy waves back.
-- Buddy looks up at awe at the animated billboard on the Lehman Building. A guy bumps into him.
WALKER
Why don't you watch your ass, buddy!
Buddy nods, then sticks his butt out and looks at it.
-- Buddy runs round and round A revolving door and loving every moment.
-- A sign at a crappy diner ""World's Best Cup of Coffee!"" Buddy is excited and enters. The jaded BANGLADESHI STAFF stares at him blankly.
BUDDY
Wow! The world's best cup of coffee! You did it! Congratulations! To all of you!
-- Gum on the ground. Yum!Buddy picks it up, plays with it, then pops it in his mouth and chews with A smile. Now his face suddenly changes.
-- Two guys are handing out different flyers. Buddy is given one. HE looks at it, then, in Marx Brothers-like fashion, hands it to flyer guy #2. Flyer guy #2 takes it, then gives Buddy one of his own flyers. This delights Buddy, who now repeats the ri
-- A dog walker picks up some dog crap with newspaper. Buddy sees some other crap on the sidewalk, grabs some newspaper and picks it up. Buddy walks right behind the man and offers it to him to be helpful.
REVEAL: Empire State Building!
Buddy holds up his Empire State Building SNOW GLOBE and compares the skyscraper to his toy one.
BUDDY
Dad...
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
ECU: The PUPPY AND THE PIGEON book is in Walter's hands. A PRINTER faces him.
WALTER
A re-print? Do you know how much that's gonna cost?
PRINTER
Two whole pages are missing. The story makes no sense.
WALTER
You think a kid is going to notice two pages? All they do is look at the pictures.
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Buddy gets in the elevator with a bunch of Republican-looking PEOPLE. He's whistling really loud and happy, confusing them.
Another passenger gets on.
ACCOUNTANT
Can you press 67 please?
Unsure of what may happen, he pushes 67. The number LIGHTS UP.
BUDDY
Hey, that's pretty.
Like lightning, he presses ALL 75 BUTTONS.
BUDDY
Look at that!
QUICK CUTS
The elevator doors open and close, floor by floor. No one is smiling, except for
Buddy.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
WALTER
How the hell did this happen, anyway?
PRINTER
Well, you signed off on all the final plates and...
WALTER
You know what? I don't need to know. Let's just get this solved.
INT. DEB'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
Deb stares dead pan at the Elf in front of her desk.
BUDDY
Buddy the Elf, here for a Mr. Walter Hobbs, please.
DEB
You look hilarious. Who sent you?
BUDDY
Papa Elf, from the North Pole.
DEB
Papa Elf? That's rich.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
PRINTER
You really think we should ship them?
WALTER
(sarcastic)
No, I want to take a thirty-thousand dollar bath, so some kid understands what happened to a friggin' Puppy and a Pigeon.
(beat)
Ship them!
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, it's me on the intercom.
WALTER
Go ahead.
DEB (O.S.)
I think someone sent you a Christmas-gram.
WALTER
A Christmas-gram? I don't have time for a Christmas-gram.
Over Walter's shoulder, we see Buddy step into frame behind him. Sensing this, Walter slowly turns around.
BUDDY
Dad?
Looking nervous and excited, he adjusts his hat and vest.
WALTER
Oh, um, alright. Let's get this over with.
We see a small crowd of people have gathered by the door to watch the supposed singing telegram.
BUDDY
I walked all day and night to find you.
WALTER
(playing along)
Looks like you came from the North Pole.
BUDDY
That's exactly where I came from. Santa must've called you.
WALTER
Yeah, I just got off my cell with him. So? Go on.
BUDDY
Go on with what?
WALTER
Are you gonna sing a song or can I get back to work?
BUDDY
A song? Anything for you, Dad. Let's see...
(trying to make up a song)
I'M HERE WITH MY DAD. I'VE NEVER MET HIM AND HE WANTS ME TO SING A SONG. I WAS ADOPTED AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BORN. BUT I'M HERE AND I LOVE YOU, DAD!!!
He hugs him.
WALTER
Wow. That's weird. Usually you guys just put my name into a Jingle Bells or something.
BUDDY
It's me, your son! Susan Welles had me and didn't tell you, but now here I am! It's me, Buddy!
WALTER
Susan Welles?! Did you just say Susan Welles? What kind of Christmas gram is this?
BUDDY
What's a Christmas gram?
WALTER
(whispering)
Deb, we may want to call security.
DEB
(whispering)
I already did.
Buddy leans in.
BUDDY
(whispering)
I like to whisper, too.
EXT. STREET - FIVE MINUTES LATER
TWO SECURITY GUARDS have each of Buddy's arms and are frog-walking him out the front doors and onto the sidewalk.
BUDDY
My dad runs this whole company! I bet he's a genius.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Must run in the family.
(they laugh)
I wouldn't come back for a while if I were you.
BUDDY
Yeah, it seemed like he may need some 'Daddy time.'
(as he's escorted)
You guys are strong!
SECURITY GUARD #1
Yeah, get lost.
BUDDY
I already am lost!
They throw Buddy's JINGLED hat at him and walk back inside.
BUDDY
Bye, Glenn. Bye Chris!
Buddy picks up his hat, dusts it off, then looks across the street and sees New York's version of ELF MECCA
REVEAL
EXT. GIMBELS DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
It's huge. Full of lights and music, Christmas at its grandest.
BUDDY
(face aglow)
Wow!
Buddy starts skipping across the street toward Gimbels when --
BAM! Buddy's hit by a CAB! He flies off-screen. This is totally shocking. Traffic stops. And now Buddy comes skipping back into frame.
BUDDY
I'm okay! Thank you!
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
The halls are decked. This is epic. Buddy walks through happy in his Elf suit. A PERFUME CLERK approaches.
PERFUME CLERK
Passion fruit spray?
BUDDY
Fruit Spray? For real?
Buddy opens his mouth and closes his eyes. The clerk just stares at him.
BUDDY
(mouth open)
Ready when you are!
The clerk looks around, then, mildly curious, sprays it i n like Binacca. PSST!
Yuch! Buddy stumbles around blind, scraping his tongue off. About to throw up.
MONTAGE: Buddy Does Gimbels
ESCALATOR
Buddy stops at the edge of an escalator, afraid to get on, like a kid at the edge of a diving board. He's clogging tons of holiday traffic.
ANGRY MAN
(annoyed)
Are you going or what?
BUDDY
Um, yeah...
Buddy steps forward with one leg. And the escalator yanks him into the splits.
BUDDY
Jiminy Christmas!
PUBLIC BATHROOM
Buddy leaves the stall, then accosts a stranger.
BUDDY
Have you seen this toilet!? It's GI-NORMOUS!!!
(to another guy)
Look at this toilet!
STORE
Buddy grabs 3,000 candy canes and starts eating them with great intensity.
ELEVATOR
Buddy faces the wrong way in the elevator, face to face with a man.
ANGRY MAN
(about to punch him)
You think you're pretty smart, huh?
BUDDY
I'm not that smart, but thanks.
LINGERIE SECTION
Buddy sees a display of sexy nighties with a sign over it: For that special someone!
BUDDY
For that special someone? Hmmm...
A HARD-ASS ELF MANAGER walks over.
ELF MANAGER
Man, what in the hell are you doing fartin' around on the first floor?
BUDDY
Looking at shiny things.
ELF MANAGER
Shiny things?? Get your butt back up to the ninth floor before I put my foot up your green ass.
BUDDY
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - 9TH FLOOR SANTA LAND - LATER
We PAN a LAME SANTA LAND. It's not very impressive. Buddy is doing a thorough inspection.
BUDDY
This snow looks fake.
ELF MANAGER
It's white, ain't it?
BUDDY
Snow doesn't just pile up unless it's moved through the use of a tool, such as a shovel. I would give this some natural erosion, a slight wind drift look.
ELF MANAGER
What the hell are you talkin' about? EROSION?! Don't touch the damn snow. What are you smiling at? You think I'm a joke?
BUDDY
Oh, no, I'm just smiling. Smiling is my favorite.
ELF MANAGER
Well take it down a notch.
Buddy tries to frown for a second, but his lips quiver and hurt and now he's smiling again, making the exact same face.
ELF MANAGER
Alright, smiley, sweep the tin foil off this path. Santa's going to be here tomorrow.
BUDDY
SANTA?!
(eyes wide)
OH...MY...GOD!!!!
(suddenly skeptical)
Wait. Santa Claus?
ELF MANAGER
Yeah. Where've you been?
BUDDY
The North Pole.
ELF MANAGER
Ha. Ha. Start elfing.
(as he leaves)
And don't touch the snow.
He walks off, looking back, annoyed. Now something grabs Buddy's full attention.
BUDDY'S POV
SLO-MO - JOVIE DAVIS. 20s, a petite beauty, dressed as an Elf. She glides like a vision to the Christmas tree where she hangs balls from a ladder. Buddy stares up at her.
JOVIE
Are you enjoying the view?
BUDDY
Yes I am! I was standing over there and I thought you looked pretty so I came over to tell you that you look pretty.
JOVIE
Why're you messin' with me? Did Krumpet put you up to this?
BUDDY
I'm not messing with you. It's nice to meet a human who shares my affinity for the Elf culture.
JOVIE
I wouldn't call it an affinity. I'm just trying to get through the holidays.
BUDDY
Get through? Christmas is the greatest day in the whole wide world!
JOVIE
Well someone's been drinking the Kool Aid.
(Buddy doesn't get it)
Believe me, after a few years of this, you'll learn to tune it all out.
BUDDY
Uh-oh. It sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol!
JOVIE
(confused)
Are you serious?
BUDDY
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
JOVIE
Well, thanks, but I don't sing.
BUDDY
Oh, it's easy! It's just like talking, only louder and longer and you move it up and down.
JOVIE
Well, I can sing. I just don't sing. Especially in front of other people. I could never do that.
BUDDY
Never? If you can sing by yourself, you can sing anytime, there's no difference.
JOVIE
Actually, there's a big difference.
BUDDY
No there isn't. Watch.
(suddenly singing loudly)
I'M IN A STORE AND I'M SINGING! PEOPLE ARE HERE AND I'M IN A STORE!!
Everyone looks at him like he's...well, Elf. Jovie seems a little uncomfortable.
BUDDY
THE STORE IS ALL SHINY AND I'M IN A STORE!!
(then back to normal)
See?
JOVIE
(bewildered)
Wow.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(over loudspeaker)
Attention, Gimbels will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your final purchases.
All the elves look relieved. Their day is over.
J
OVIE
Dismissed.
BUDDY
You're leaving? But Santa's coming.
JOVIE
(she laughs at his 'joke')
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, um, what's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
JOVIE
Jovie. See ya.
With that, Jovie walks off. Buddy looks around as the half-baked Santa Land empties out.
QUICK SERIES OF CUTS
The doors being locked, employees exiting, lights flickering off.
A SECURITY GUARD WALKS DOWN AN AISLE
Behind him, Buddy does a commando roll through the aisle. Then pops up next to some toys.
Buddy starts pulling all sorts of things off the shelves: paint, robots, a fire truck...he looks at a logo.
BUDDY
They have Elves in Taiwan?
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
EMILY has prepared a beautiful dinner. She is an attractive, upper East-side woman.
Walter fills a plate. Their son, MICHAEL, 10, eats without enthusiasm, detached.
WALTER
I'm gonna go eat in my den, okay? I've got a bunch of stuff to go over.
EMILY
Are you sure?
WALTER
Yeah, I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
He goes to kiss her on the forehead, she doesn't offer it. So he kisses the top of her hair...and now leaves.
MICHAEL
Can I eat in my room?
EMILY
No.
MICHAEL
Why not? Dad's eating in his den.
(smart ass)
I have a bunch of homework to go over...I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
EMILY
You're eating here.
MICHAEL
Fine. But I'm not going to talk.
EMILY
Yes you are. You're going to tell me how your day was.
(beat)
How was your day?
Michael stares tight-lipped. This infuriates Emily.
EMILY
(suddenly)
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?!
MICHAEL
It was fine! Okay? Good.
INT. WALTER'S DEN - LATER
Walter is looking at an OLD YEAR BOOK. He studies a picture of a young, beautiful 'Susan Welles.'
EMILY
What're you looking at?
Walter hides the book.
WALTER
Nothing. It's for work.
EMILY
You know, it'd be nice if we ate together as a family once in a while.
WALTER
I'm sorry. I've gotta work. How do you think I feel? You think I like to work?
EMILY
Actually, I do.
(beat)
I'm really worried about Michael. He's getting detached and cynical. They're not supposed to do that until they're teenagers.
WALTER
Well he is thirteen years old.
EMILY
He's ten.
(exasperated)
I don't know what's going on with you, but I've just about had it.
WALTER
Had it with what?
That was the wrong answer.
WALTER
Emily. Wait. I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of stress at work.
EMILY
If you say the word WORK one more time, you're sleeping at the Marriot.
WALTER
(a tiny ounce of charm)
The chicken thing was delicious.
EMILY
It wasn't a chicken thing. It was salmon, zucchini, string beans, carrots, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and olives.
WALTER
Well it was good.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - 7 AM
Buddy is finishing his decorating. We pull out wide: No Santa Land has ever looked more beautiful. The most expensive merchandise has been used as bricks and mortar. A huge glitter sign says ""WELCOME SANTA! LOVE, BUDDY!!!""
Now, off in the distance, WE HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF AN ANGEL SINGING.
Buddy perks up, training his ear, he slowly rises to his feet, as if following a butterfly, he meanders through the deserted aisles, more and more hypnotized as the angelic singing gets louder and louder and clearer and more beautiful.
Buddy pushes through the bathroom door, totally consumed by the greatest voice in the world.
REVEAL
Jovie is in the shower stall. Singing half of the classic duet, ""BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE"". Buddy stands, hypnotized, outside the shower curtain, quietly joins in and sings the accompanying duet to himself. Eventually he can't help himself and belts out the chorus.
Jovie is silent and quickly twists off the shower and opens the curtain, wearing only a towel.
JOVIE
AHHHHHHHH!!!
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHH!!!
Jovie KICKS BUDDY in the NUTS and escapes. Buddy holds his crotch, confused and frightened.
EXT. GIMBELS - MORNING
A busy Manhattan morning. People are going back to work.
PAN TO
Behind the glass, an idyllic Christmas scene. Buddy is curled up in the faux snow, asleep -- mouth open and drooling, sweaty from the sun.
A MAN SQUINTS
At him through the window amazed at how life-like Buddy is. Buddy itches his crotch, then awakens to the staring man.
BUDDY
Ah! Holy fudge!
Buddy yawns and stretches ridiculously.
BUDDY
Good morning, everyone!
(looking off)
POV
Walter is walking along the sidewalk with his brief case.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Walter thinks he hears something, but continues. Buddy pounds hard on the window, trapped like a tiger. His voice echoes. Muffled like Dustin Hoffman in THE GRADUATE.
BUDDY
(muted)
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!
Walter glances over, then stops in his tracks. It's Buddy. He runs.
INT. LOBBY - LATER
Buddy skips past the security guards with a box. Caught off guard, they have to lunge to grab him.
SECURITY GUARD #1
Hey!
BUDDY
(yelling back; fun)
Hey!!
(beat)
Hi, Glenn. Hi Chris! I just want to give my dad this present. I think he's mad at me...but he won't be after THIS.
SECURITY GUARD #1
You better leave that with us.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Yeah, he's real busy.
BUDDY
Oh, okay. Well, please tell him it's from me, and that I love him so much and that he's the greatest Dad in the world and that I love him. Okay?
SECURITY GUARD #1
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - DAY
Buddy re-enters his new, transformed Santa Land. His face glows with satisfaction.
REVEAL
It's a smash hit. The visitors are ecstatic. 'Look at that!' 'Can you believe it?' etc. Everyone loves it. Except the Elf Manager, who complains to a co-worker.
ELF MANAGER
Who the hell took a dump in housewares?
Jovie walks up to Buddy.
JOVIE
Hey. I want to talk to you.
Buddy is now terrified by her.
BUDDY
Oh, uh, um, okay, uh...
(she lets him squirm)
What do you want to talk about?
JOVIE
What the hell do you think?
BUDDY
I know a pig who can run eleven miles an hour.
JOVIE
Why were you in the woman's locker room?
BUDDY
(sheephish)
I heard you singing.
JOVIE
Singing? Right. I'm sure it had nothing to do with me being naked. I should call the police.
(beat)
What were you doing here so early in the morning?
BUDDY
(re: epic Santa Land)
Making this.
JOVIE
You made this?
BUDDY
Yes...why were you here?
JOVIE
They turned my water off.
(she studies him)
You were standing there with your eyes closed. What is that, some kind of thing you do?
Buddy looks to the floor, and now up and into her eyes.
BUDDY
You have the most beautiful voice in the whole world.
Jovie looks at him, his innocence is contagious.
JOVIE
(sincere, compassionate)
You really were just listening to me, weren't you?
BUDDY
I'm sorry.
The Elf Manager walks over.
MANAGER
This is Santa Land, not stand-around-and-wear-pointy-ass-shoes land. Get busy. Santa's here.
BUDDY
SANTA?! Santa is HERE?!
Buddy sees the back of Santa enter a closed off gazebo. Children are already crowded around.
BUDDY
(happier than ever)
SANTA!
Buddy rushes towards Santa through the crowd, his eyes wide, almost breathless with excitement. Quickly he brushes off his uniform and straightens his cap.
BUDDY
Santa, it's me! Buddy!
Buddy slides the curtain open to reveal: a MAN dressed as Santa. The kids cheer. Buddy's smile drops.
BUDDY
Who the heck are you?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why, I'm Santa Claus.
BUDDY
Are not!
GIMBELS SANTA
Well, of course I am. Ho Ho Ho!
BUDDY
(furious)
If you're Santa, then tell me. What song did I sing for your birthday this year?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why you sang, uh, Happy Birthday?
BUDDY
(to the kids)
He's right.
'Santa' struts past Buddy and takes his chair.
GIMBELS SANTA
(under his breath)
Why don't you cool it, zippy.
(to the kids)
Ho Ho Ho!
The voice is wrong, the smell is wrong.
BUDDY
You're lying! I know it!
Buddy attacks. He grabs Santa's bear and it comes right off. Buddy looks at the beard in shock, like a horror movie.
BUDDY
(at the beard, horrified)
AAHHHH!!! Imposter! He's an imposter!!! His beard is fake! Come on, kids, get him!
The kids all pile on, wrestling Santa, loving it. Now the manager dives in and tries to help. Some parents and other elves try to contain the disaster in panic.
Jovie giggles. She is confused but intrigued by this mysterious stranger.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - GREENWAY PRESS - DAY
Walter sits behind his desk staring at the note that accompanied the package from Buddy. The package sits on the desk, still wrapped in a Gimbels box. The note says ""Dad, this is for you because you are my special someone.""
Walter unwraps the gift, then holds up a RED SLINKY NIGHTIE with fur where the nipples would be.
Deb enters and he scrambles to hide the nightie.
DEB
Hey the -- what's that?
WALTER
What's what?
(beat)
Intercom!
DEB
Right.
She leaves. Walter looks deeper into the box and sees a card. It's the old photo of a young Walter next to his smiling girlfriend - on the other side is a crayon drawing of Buddy.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Walter, the police are on line one.
WALTER
The police?
(grabbing phone)
Hello? My son? Michael? Is he okay?
(listening)
An Elf? He's not my -- you know what? Keep him there. I'll be right down.
Deb peeks in.
DEB
What's going on?
WALTER
Nothing. I need to go.
(lying)
I need to swing by my apartment real quick...they're delivering a chair.
DEB
(smart ass)
A police chair?
WALTER
It's a regular chair. Okay?! Cancel my appointments.
INT. JAIL - DAY
A scary jail cell. Buddy looks around from his cot. Everything is cold and hard and ugly and mean.
And now he STARTS TO CRY. He sticks his face into the pillow and cries hard.
REVEAL
Another convict shares the cell with him. He stares at Buddy with disgust.
But now, slowly, it's contagious. The CONVICT CAN'T HELP IT AND HE STARTS TO CRY TOO.
Buddy hears the cell door clang open.
REVEAL
Walter stands at the open jail cell door.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Buddy wipes his tears and rubs his face. Trying to look like a good son.
The convict wipes his tears away too, sitting up straight. But now starts crying again.
EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
Walter marches out of the front doors, Buddy following closely behind, almost like a puppy dog trying to keep up.
Walter is about to burst but holds back, until they're clear of the station.
BUDDY
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come! I love that you came and I love you Dad! Know how much I love you?
(spreading his arms wide)
This much. Except my arms would have to be way longer, like pterodactyl wings --
WALTER
Alright, pal. Who the heck are you and what's your problem?
BUDDY
I'm Buddy. Your son.
WALTER
I already have a son!
BUDDY
Then who am I?
WALTER
Where did you get this picture?!
He holds up the picture he included in the gift.
BUDDY
Papa Elf gave it to me.
Walter shakes Buddy violently by the lapels. Buddy's scared.
WALTER
Is this some kind of game? What do you want, money?!
BUDDY
I just wanted to meet you...and I thought that, maybe, you might want to meet me...
Walter senses an element of truth in here somewhere.
WALTER
(serious)
You really believe this, don't you?
BUDDY
I thought we could make ginger bread houses and eat cookie dough and go ice skating and hold hands. I'm sorry if I made you mad.
WALTER
(conflicted)
Come with me.
Their silhouettes walk together away from camera. Buddy REACHES OUT TO HOLD HANDS, but Walter's hands stay in his trench coat...Buddy is still holding his hand out. Walter suddenly SMACKS BUDDY'S HAND DOWN.
INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER
Buddy sits on the examining table as Walter watches.
PROP NOTE: Del Close's skull sits on a shelf in the B.G.
Buddy reaches into a jar of cotton balls and starts eating them quickly one at a time. Like cotton candy nuggets.
WALTER
Don't eat those.
Buddy goes to eat one more, Walter tries to grab his arm but Buddy fakes him out and eats it anyway.
BUDDY
Am I sick?
WALTER
YES.
(beat)
But that's not why we're here. We're here to test whether you're my son or not.
BUDDY
Why am I sitting on paper?
Buddy pulls the roll and paper spills out everywhere. The doctor and Walter try to stop him, but get tangled up.
DOCTOR
So it's clean for each patient that comes in. Try to sit still. I'm going to perform something called a 'finger prick.'
BUDDY
(happy)
Finger prick!
(to the Doctor)
Can I wear your head lamp?
DOCTOR
No.
BUDDY
Why?
DOCTOR
Just sit still.
BUDDY
Why is there a skeleton on the wall?
DOCTOR
I don't know but there just is.
BUDDY
What's his name?
WALTER
He doesn't have a name!
BUDDY
If I squint, he looks like a pirate flag. Arrgh!
DOCTOR
Walter, I can't do this if he's going to keep moving around.
WALTER
I'm sorry Ben. Buddy! Please!
BUDDY
(whispering)
He got mad at me.
WALTER
Buddy the sooner you sit still, the sooner we can clear up this horrible mess.
BUDDY
After this, can we eat sugar plums together?
WALTER
Sure! We'll eat sugar plums, and make ginger bread houses, and paint eggs!
BUDDY
That's Easter not -
The Doctor gives Buddy's finger a tiny prick.
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Buddy shoves the doctor over and stumbles around holding his finger and crying.
BUDDY
Boot straps! Snow flickers! Son of a cobbler!
INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER
Buddy holds his finger with a cotton ball for a moment. Then suddenly eats it.
Now he taps his finger and flips it around like it's dead, then turns to a LITTLE GIRL, 7, who is playing with her doll as her MOTHER fills out paperwork with the nurse.
BUDDY
My finger has a heartbeat.
GIRL
It won't hurt so much after a little. What's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
GIRL
I'm Carolyn.
BUDDY
And what do you want for Christmas?
CAROLYN
A Suzie-Talks-A-Lot.
BUDDY
I'll put in a good word with the big man.
CAROLYN
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
BUDDY
Oh, it's not a costume. I'm an Elf. Well, I'm a human, technically. But I was raised by Elves.
GIRL
(totally unfazed)
Oh. I'm a human...raised by humans.
BUDDY
Cool.
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter is waiting for the results.
WALTER
Well?
DOCTOR
Well...
(beat)
It's a boy.
The blood drains out of Walter's face.
WALTER
It's impossible.
(feeling faint)
Is the test ever wrong?
DOCTOR
No.
WALTER
My God. What'm I supposed to do? You saw the guy, he's certifiably insane!
DOCTOR
Walter, I've read about some things that suggest Buddy's behavior isn't necessarily that unusual.
WALTER
The man skips.
DOCTOR
It's rare, but there have been documented cases of people like your son.
WALTER
His name's BUDDY.
DOCTOR
Well, BUDDY's been denied a proper childhoood with you. It's possible he may feel he was never fully nurtured, causing an alternative personality to develop.
WALTER
An Elf.
DOCTOR
Yes.
(beat)
I think he's trying to return to a position of child-like dependency.
WALTER
So, let's get him some pills or whatever. I'll pay for them, it's not a problem.
DOCTOR
I think what he really needs is you. This is an extreme case. A rejection now could be especially traumatic.
WALTER
So, what do you want me to do, breast feed him?
DOCTOR
What if you let him visit you? Meet the family, that sort of thing. It may help him feel like he's a part of your life.
(off Walter's look)
He's your son Walter, it's not like he's going to just go away.
EXT. EMILY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Emily is leaving work, locking up the door. She turns to find Walter standing there at the bottom of the steps, hands in his pockets, smiling.
EMILY
What are you doing here?
WALTER
I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd walk you home.
EMILY
You thought you'd walk me home?
They begin to walk together.
WALTER
What, is that so weird?
EMILY
I've worked here for four years. You've never walked me anywhere.
WALTER
Well it's a nice night.
EMILY
What's wrong?
WALTER
Why does something have to be wrong? I just said, it's a nice night, I mean really!
EMILY
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
(taking his arm)
Thanks, this is really nice.
On Walter as he walks.
WALTER
Okay, something's a little wrong.
INT. HOBB'S RESIDENCE - LATER
They're arriving home.
EMILY
Oh, God...that's well, it's...it's Wonderful Walter. You have a son.
WALTER
Wonderful. That's one way to put it.
EMILY
Oh c'mon. This is incredible. It may be a little complicated, but it's nothing we can't handle.
WALTER
He thinks he's an Elf.
EMILY
I'm sorry, what?
WALTER
He thinks he's a Christmas Elf.
EMILY
Oh, I'm sure he doesn't really think...
Walter swings open the door to the apartment to reveal:
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
BUDDY HAS BEEN BUSY. The place is a recycled winter wonderland. Yards of old garland has been meticulously strung throughout the apartment. Elaborate construction paper Christmas murals cover the walls. His sense of decorating is impeccable. Emily is floored.
MEANWHILE...in the kitchen, Buddy scoops globs of frosting into his mouth at a furious pace.
WALTER
Buddy?
Buddy looks up, drooling.
WALTER
This is Emily.
EMILY
(muffled, mouth full)
Emuree!
Swallows frosting hard. He jumps up and gives her a big hug.
BUDDY
Walter hasn't told me anything about you!!!
Meanwhile, Michael, their son, has arrived.
MICHAEL
Why is mom hugging Robin Hood?
INT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
Walter, Emily, Michael and Buddy are seated around the dining room table eating spaghetti.
BUDDY
...then I traveled through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, past the castle of the abominable snowman and past the sea of swirly, twirly gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln tunnel. Can you pass the Coke pretty please?
Michael hands over a two-liter. Instead of pouring it in his glass, Buddy chugs the entire thing. The family watches, amazed.
EMILY
So, where exactly have you been for the last thirty years?
WALTER
The North Pole. He's an ""Elf"". That's where elves live.
BUDDY
He's right. Can you pass the maple syrup, pretty please.
EMILY
I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti.
BUDDY
That's okay, I think I have some...
Buddy pulls some syrup out of his breast pocket and pours it over his spaghetti. Walter and Michael share a disgusted look, the first time they've been in agreement on anything in a while.
EMILY
You like sugar, huh?
BUDDY
Is there sugar in syrup?
EMILY
Yes.
BUDDY
Then yes! We Elves try to stick to the four basic food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.
EMILY
So, will you be staying with us, then?
WALTER
Emily.
BUDDY
You mean I can stay?
WALTER
Emily!
EMILY
Oh, don't be silly. Of course you can. How long do you think you'll be with us?
BUDDY
Well, I hadn't really planned it out, but I was thinking, like, forever?
WALTER
EMILY!?
EMILY
WHAT?!
WALTER
May I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
EMILY
Um, sure. Excuse me, Buddy.
Left alone, Buddy stares at Michael. Michael ignores him. Turning his whole chair away. Buddy looks around for a moment. And now suddenly BURPS so loud and long, it's insane.
BUDDY
Wow, did you hear that?
Yes, Michael did...
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Walter argues with Emily in hushed tones.
WALTER
Are you crazy? He can't stay here.
EMILY
Clearly he has some serious issues. We can't just kick him out in the snow.
WALTER
Why not? He loves the snow! He told me fifteen times!
EMILY
Seriously Walter! He's alone in New York. What's he supposed to do?
WALTER
That's his problem.
EMILY
He's your son. That means it's our problem.
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Michael sit in silence. Buddy isn't sure what to say.
BUDDY
I love you.
MICHAEL
Eat me.
BUDDY
Eat you? OKAY!
(playing, like the jungle)
I'm a Lion! Roar! CHOMP!
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
Buddy is on the living room couch. Walter is tucking him in, trying to leave.
BUDDY
Goodnight, Dad.
WALTER
Goodnight.
BUDDY
Tuck me in?
WALTER
What?!
BUDDY
I can't fall asleep if I'm not tucked in.
WALTER
I'm not tucking you in!
BUDDY
I promise I'll go right to sleep.
WALTER
(reluctantly)
Fine...
BUDDY
TICKLE FIGHT!!!
Walter fights him off, pissed.
WALTER
No. Buddy. Stop!
BUDDY
Sorry.
WALTER
Just lay down and go to sleep, okay?
BUDDY
Do you want to hear a story?
WALTER
No. When this light goes off, you are not getting up. Understand?
BUDDY
Understand.
(Walter flicks off light)
Dad?
(flicks light on)
WALTER
What?
BUDDY
I love you.
WALTER
Go to sleep.
BUDDY
Do you love me?
WALTER
Yeah sure. Now go to sleep.
BUDDY
How much do you love me. Like on a scale from one to ten?
WALTER
Well, I haven't known you for very long, but I would say my feelings are...significant.
BUDDY
(to himself; satisfied)
Significant
WALTER
Good night.
The lights go out for the last time. Walter closes the door and Buddy is alone in the DARK.
BUDDY
(in the dark)
Dad.
(long beat)
Dad?
(long beat)
DAD?
(long beat)
DAD?!
(longer beat)
DAD!!!!
The door suddenly swings open and light shoots into the room.
WALTER
WHAT!!!
BUDDY
Hi.
Walter slams the door. It's dark again.
BUDDY
Dad?
INT. HOBBS' KITCHEN - MORNING
Buddy has prepared a huge batch of spaghetti. The table is set up like a deranged thanksgiving feast. Buddy, the host, hurries around the kitchen as Emily eats.
EMILY
This sure is something, I'm usually the one making breakfast.
BUDDY
Want some more spaghetti?
EMILY
Um, sure, why not.
Buddy dumps more spaghetti on her plate. Then sprinkles it with candy snow caps.
EMILY
So how'd you sleep last night?
BUDDY
Great. I got a full forty minutes and still had time to build a rocking horse.
We see a painted and trimmed rocking horse in the corner.
EMILY
My gosh, you built that? Where did you get the wood?
WALTER (O.S.)
Why is the TV on the ground?
REVEAL:
The ENTERTAINMENT CENTER has been completely dismantled to provide wood for the rocking horse. Sawdust and paint litter the living room.
Walter walks into the kitchen, flabbergasted.
EMILY
Good morning, honey.
(she kisses her husband)
Buddy made us breakfast, isn't that nice?
Walter looks at the...spaghetti. So many things to say, but no place to begin.
EMILY
He packed us lunches too.
REVEAL:
THREE BAGS of spaghetti have each person's name written in calligraphy.
EMILY
Well, I gotta run. Thanks for breakfast, Buddy.
(grabbing her bag)
And the lunch!
She kisses him on the cheek and leaves.
BUDDY
Bye Emily!
Buddy takes a huge spoon and lifts three pounds of spaghetti into frame.
BUDDY
(to Walter)
So, how many scoops?
WALTER
I'm going to stick with coffee for now.
Now MICHAEL ENTERS. He doesn't care to notice the weird food.
MICHAEL
(to Walter, awkward)
I need my allowance.
WALTER
(awkward)
Did you do the recycling?
MICHAEL
Yeah, I did, okay?
Walter peels off a twenty and Michael immediately shoves it into his pocket.
BUDDY
How come you guys don't hug? We always hug in the morning.
WALTER
(lying)
We hugged earlier.
MICHAEL
(partner in crime)
Yeah, we hugged already. Bye.
BUDDY
Bye!
Walter and Buddy are now alone.
WALTER
Listen, Buddy, I wanted to talk to you.
BUDDY
Good, I wanted to talk to you too. I've planned our whole day...
He's made a list on the Etch-a-sketch.
BUDDY
First we make snow angels for two hours, then we go ice-skating and then we eat a log of toll house cookie dough as fast as we can and then, to wrap up the day, we snuggle.
WALTER
Buddy, I have to go to work.
(beat)
And another thing, if you're going to be staying here, you should think about getting rid of the costume. We've got neighbors and people around here, you know?
BUDDY
(looking at himself)
I've worn this my whole life.
WALTER
Yeah, well, you're not in the North Pole anymore.
Buddy is unsure.
WALTER
You said you wanted to make me happy, didn't you?
BUDDY
More than anything.
WALTER
Then lose the tights...as soon as possible.
BUDDY
As soon as possible?
WALTER
As soon as possible.
BUDDY
(sighing)
Yes, papa.
Walter turns and faces camera, pouring coffee. Behind him, Buddy TAKES HIS GREEN TIGHTS OFF and stands there NAKED from the waist down. (The audience is spared the details).
From the rear, Emily re-enters the kitchen and sees Buddy from behind.
EMILY
I almost forg --- AHHHHH!!!!!!
Walter spills his coffee and turns to see Buddy from the front.
WALTER
AHHHHHHH!!!!
BUDDY
(as if it's a game)
AHHHHH!!!!
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
Walking to work, Walter answers his cell phone.
WALTER
(answering his cell)
Walter Hobbs.
BUDDY (O.S.)
(from phone)
It worked! It's you!
We intercut Buddy at home, he's shocked by the technology.
WALTER
How'd you get this number?
BUDDY
Emily left an emergency list.
WALTER
Is there an emergency?
BUDDY
There's a horrible sound coming from the evil box by the window! It sounds like this: ERIEKKKCTH!
Walter's ear is trashed before he can pull the phone away.
WALTER
It's not evil. It's the radiator. The heat makes noise when it comes on.
BUDDY
No it's not. Wait yes it is, you were right. Everything's fine!
WALTER
I'm hanging up now.
BUDDY
Okay, I love you, I'll call you in five minutes, I love you!
WALTER
You don't need to call me, Buddy, okay?
BUDDY
Good idea. You call me.
WALTER
Okay, I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I have a present for you when you get home!
WALTER
I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I love you!
EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - LATER
Dozens of kids stream out of school.
Michael is in the middle of the crowd when he hears his name from across the street.
BUDDY (O.S.)
MICHAEL! MICHAEL!
He looks over and sees Buddy cutting through traffic.
MICHAEL
(turns away in embarrassment)
Oh man.
BUDDY
It's me, your brother! Hey, Michael!
Kids start to notice and begin laughing, Michael can't bare it. Michael walks away, ignoring Buddy.
BUDDY
Michael! Wait up!
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
Michael is walking through the park, Buddy trails twelve feet behind, sort of hiding behind trees. But not really.
Michael finally turns and confronts him.
MICHAEL
LEAVE!
BUDDY
How about I leave, then you count to ten and come find me?
MICHAEL
This isn't a game, spaz. Leave NOW. For REAL.
BUDDY
You really want me to leave
MICHAEL
Yes.
BUDDY
(sad)
Oh. Okay. I'll uh, leave, then. I'm sorry.
Just then, a SNOWBALL WHACKS MICHAEL IN THE SHOULDER.
EDGE OF THE RAVINE
A big bunch of JACKASS WANNA-BE teenagers look down at them and laugh.
MICHAEL
Oh, no. These guy are bad news. We better get out of here.
Thump! Michael gets hit in the head.
BUDDY
Ow! PEANUT BRITTLE! SON OF A NUTCRACKER!
Now a barrage of snowballs rain down upon them and they dive behind a fallen tree trunk as snow missiles rip into the barricade.
BUDDY
Dive!
MICHAEL
(genuinely worried)
There are too many of them!
BUDDY
We can do this! Make as many snowballs as you can!
Michael quickly sculpts two snowballs.
WE PAN BACK
To see Buddy has already rounded out a pile of THIRTY.
BUDDY
Ready?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
WIDE SHOT
We can't see Buddy, but we can see the snowballs shooting out of his bunker like a machine gun. A Nolan Ryan fastball ever 1.5 Seconds.
A series of targets explode with precision as this blur of snowballs hits guts, butts, nuts and faces. A kid raises a snowball and it immediately explodes out of his hand. This is the one thing Buddy's actually better at than hockey.
Michael stands to launch one. Exposing himself.
BUDDY
Noooo!
Michael is frozen with shock as a HUGE KID winds up and releases a snowball right at him. Buddy fires a snowball that hits the incoming snowball exploding both of them in mid-air like a patriot missile. They both sit panting.
BUDDY
He's bunkered in! I'm going to flank around from the East. If I don't make it, tell my Dad I love him.
Buddy jumps and charges - and now Michael follows. Buddy descends upon the guy, launching a flurry of snow. The guy finally raises his arms and steps up slowly in surrender.
Buddy looks at the GUY WITH HIS ARMS UP, then winds up and explodes a snowball off his chest at close range.
SNOWBALL GUY
Ow!
(holding his chest)
Hey, I surrendered!
BUDDY
(to Michael)
What does surrendered mean?
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter does some paperwork, then hits the intercom.
WALTER
Can you bring me in a bottle of water please?
DEB (O.S.)
(from the intercom)
Fulton Greenway is on his way in.
Fulton Greenway? Walter immediately loses blood in his face.
WALTER
Fulton Greenway? Why didn't you tell me?
DEB (O.S.)
He just showed up. What size water?
WALTER
When's he coming in?
DEB (O.S.)
Now.
WALTER
What do you mean now?
Walter buttons his suit and checks his reflection for nose hairs.
DEB (O.S.)
I mean now. What size?
FULTON GREENWAY (O.S.)
Hobbs!
FULTON GREENWAY, the cut-throat looking owner of the company enters the office. This guy owns Greenway Press, among other things.
WALTER
Fulton! What a great surprise!
FULTON GREENWAY
I haven't seen you since the retreat. You're looking good.
WALTER
Thanks, you too. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
FULTON GREENWAY
Well, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.
WALTER
Your niece. I don't think I've met her.
FULTON GREENWAY
She's six.
Fulton tosses 'THE PUPPY AND THE PIGEON (the flawed book from earlier) onto Walter's desk. Uh oh.
FULTON GREENWAY
She wants to know how a certain puppy and a certain pigeon escaped the clutches of a certain evil witch.
WALTER
Believe me, we've already started looking at new printers. This one's obviously gotten sloppy.
Greenway holds up the proofs, signed by Walter.
FULTON GREENWAY
Maybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.
WALTER
(forcing a laugh)
What a disaster, huh? Twenty-five years in publishing, never seen anything like it. Well, I guess you can't bat a thousand, right?
Fulton Greenway nods skeptically. Walter adjusts in his seat.
FULTON GREENWAY
I got news for you, even if those two pages were in there, that book still would have sucked. I read it. I'll tell you, I wish all the pages were missing.
(Walter's dying)
Have you seen the numbers from this quarter?
WALTER
They should be coming in today.
FULTON GREENWAY
(holds up the numbers)
They're in!
WALTER
That good, huh?
FULTON GREENWAY
The Pigeon and the Friggin' Puppy is tanking hard, Hobbs. My people estimate we'll be posting a minus eight for this quarter. A minus eight cannot happen.
WALTER
Well, we'll bounce back. We always do.
FULTON GREENWAY
We're not going to 'bounce back.' We're going to get a new book before the end of the quarter.
WALTER
Before the end of this quarter?
FULTON GREENWAY
I'll be back in town on the twenty fourth. At that time, I'd love to hear, in great detail, exactly what your plans are for this new book.
WALTER
But that's Christmas Eve.
FULTON GREENWAY
And?
WALTER
Hey, no problem. It'll be fun to have you in the loop.
INT. GIMBELS - LATER THAT DAY
Buddy and Michael are goofing around inside Gimbels. Buddy pegs him with a dodge ball. Michael laughs and pegs him back.
MICHAEL
(looking at toy bugs)
Hey, look at this, it's a big mosquito!
BUDDY
What's a mosquito?
MICHAEL
They land on your arm, then stick their needle face down through your skin, suck your blood out and then fly away.
BUDDY
That's a scary toy.
MICHAEL
It's not just a toy. They're real. They're everywhere in the summer.
BUDDY
(horrified)
OH MY GOD.
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
They leave the toy section and walk toward the SANTA LAND that Buddy built. We see the sign has been awkwardly changed to 'Welcome, Santa. Love GIMBELS.'
BUDDY
I wish Dad were here.
MICHAEL
Why?
BUDDY
He's the greatest Dad in the world.
MICHAEL
Are you kidding? He's the worst dad in the world.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
MICHAEL
All he does is work.
BUDDY
Working is fun.
MICHAEL
Not the way he does it. All he cares about is the money. He doesn't care about me, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about anybody.
BUDDY
Well, he is on the naughty list.
AND NOW WE SPOT JOVIE
From a distance. She looked adorable before, but this time we're serious.
MICHAEL
You like her?
BUDDY
Like who?
MICHAEL
The girl you're staring at.
BUDDY
Um, yes.
MICHAEL
Why don't you ask her out?
BUDDY
Out to where?
MEANWHILE
Jovie has spotted Buddy. She gives him a shy wave. And now she's WALKING OVER to them.
BUDDY
(flipping out)
We should leave. I need to leave.
MICHAEL
Don't leave! Ask her out!
BUDDY
Out?
MICHAEL
On a date, you know, to eat food.
BUDDY
(Jovie's almost there)
Food.
MICHAEL
(whispering)
If she says yes, you're in. It's like a secret code girls have.
JOVIE
Well look who it is.
BUDDY
Hi Jovie. This is --
Michael has ditched out. Buddy is on his own.
BUDDY
...that's my brother, Michael, over there.
JOVIE
I was wondering if I'd ever see you again. So, did Gimbels give you your job back?
BUDDY
No, but it worked out pretty good. They gave me a restraining order.
JOVIE
You really should get out of here.
BUDDY
But I really wanted to see you. You're beautiful and I feel warm when I'm around you. You make my tongue swell up.
Jovie is embarrassed.
JOVIE
You are the weirdest guy I've ever met in my life.
BUDDY
Weird, like, good?
JOVIE
(smiling)
I haven't decided.
BUDDY
So, do you want to eat food?
JOVIE
Do I want to eat food?
BUDDY
You know...
(winking)
The code...
JOVIE
(letting that slide)
I just took my lunch break.
BUDDY
(defeated)
Oh, right. I follow.
JOVIE
(then)
But I'm free Thursday night.
A wry smile slowly breaks across Buddy's face. And then he suddenly explodes.
BUDDY
(celebrating; ridiculous)
YYEEESSSSSSSSS!
INT. HOBBS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Walter enters and sees Buddy and Michael as they hoist an enormous FOURTEEN FOOT TALL CHRISTMAS TREE into the corner. It scrapes the ceiling as they wedge it in place.
WALTER
What the hell is that?
MICHAEL
A Christmas tree!
WALTER
A Christmas tree?
MICHAEL
Buddy chopped it down in the park!
Buddy smiles at Walter, Walter does not smile back.
INT. WALTER AND EMILY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Michael and Emily are having a heated discussion.
EMILY
I don't know what you're so worked up about. They're just having a little fun.
WALTER
Fun? Felonies are fun now? I thought felonies were felonies?
EMILY
Okay, the tree thing was bad. We'll have to plant another one. But at least
Michael's happy for once.
(beat)
It's amazing what a little attention will do.
WALTER
What's that supposed to mean?
EMILY
Well, you haven't exactly been there for him lately. He's a kid Walter, he's not going to raise himself.
WALTER
Oh! So let's allow a deranged Elf-man to raise him. Great idea! Maybe we should pull Michael out of school so they can commit felonies full time!
EMILY
I think you're jealous.
WALTER
Jealous? Of Buddy? The man is wearing tights.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MEANWHILE
Buddy uses a drill to secure the trunk to the floor. ZZZZRRrrrr. He then stands at a distance. Like a high jumper, holding a star for the top of the tree in hand.
POV
He eyes a mini-trampoline. Then the top of the tree. And now looks at the star in his hand. This has bad news written all over it.
MICHAEL
Are you sure about this? Maybe we can get a ladder.
BUDDY
A ladder? What's fun about a ladder?
(concentrating)
Ready?
(taking off)
WATCH!!!!
Buddy runs, hits the trampoline, launches himself way off target, shooting a sharp angle into the nearest wall. BAM! HE falls behind the couch and out of sight.
BUDDY (O.S.)
I'm okay.
(then)
I found a quarter!
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
WALTER
What was that noise?
EMILY
Sounded like Buddy slamming into the wall and falling behind the couch.
WALTER
That guy's a liability. There's no way we're leaving him alone here tomorrow. He'll trash the place. Maybe you should take tomorrow off and, you know, watch him.
EMILY
I can't just take off work. I'm going upstate tomorrow for budget meetings.
WALTER
Well I can't stay home. I'm one bad pitch away from getting fired.
EMILY
Why don't you take him to work with you?
WALTER
Take him to work with me?
EMILY
Yeah, I bet he'd like it.
WALTER
Absolutely never.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
The ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS open to reveal Walter & Buddy. Buddy sports a new suit. He looks ever bit the professional as he enters with his father.
CO-WORKER
Hey, Walter.
WALTER
Hey, Jack.
BUDDY
Hello, Jack!
Another co-worker, #2, nods hello.
WALTER
Hey, Sarah.
BUDDY
Hi, Sarah. I love that purple dress. It's purplie.
CO-WORKER #3
How's it going, Walter?
WALTER
Hello, Francisco.
BUDDY
Hey, Francisco! That's fun to say! Francisco!
WALTER
(whispering)
Could you at least lose that damn hat?
BUDDY
I like the hat.
(off Walter's look)
I could try, but I really like it.
INT. HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter sits down at his scattered desk. Deb follows him in with his morning cup of coffee.
WALTER
Thanks, Deb.
BUDDY
Good morning, Deb! You have a very pretty face! You should be on a Christmas card!
DEB
Uh, thanks.
She leaves. Walter watches as Buddy grabs ten different books and immediately decides they're boring.
BUDDY
(to himself)
Fran-cis-co.
WALTER
We're cutting down on your sugar intake.
BUDDY
Why is your name on the door?
WALTER
I bought that door. My name's there so no one else steals it.
BUDDY
Is that a joke, Dad?
WALTER
Yes.
BUDDY
This is your office, isn't it?
WALTER
Well how about that? He's understanding sarcasm.
BUDDY
So what are we going to build?
WALTER
This really isn't that kind of work.
THE PHONE RINGS, Buddy beats Walter to it.
BUDDY
(super-fast into phone)
Buddy the Elf! What's your favorite color?
Walter hangs up the phone.
WALTER
Please don't touch anything!
(beat)
Listen, Buddy, have you ever seen a mail room before?
BUDDY
(excited)
A mail room? No.
WALTER
Mail from all over the world gets sorted all in one place! And some of the bins are shiny.
BUDDY
(dreaming)
Shiny...
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Yelling voices, loud machinery and blaring hip-hop fill the place. YOUNG, URBAN WORKERS in criminal apparel wrap and unwrap massive parcels.
The elevator dings open to reveal Buddy, alone, frightened. The floor manager, CHUCK, spots Buddy.
FLOOR MANAGER
You Buddy?
(Buddy nods)
Well come on out of the elevator then.
BUDDY
Okay.
Floor manager leads Buddy over to the main work area.
FLOOR MANAGER
Welcome to the pit.
TREY, an enormous, bald African-American man and CRAIG, a bald, wiry kid with a neck tattoo, stop their sorting and look up at Buddy with threatening glares.
FLOOR MANAGER
...over here is the trench. All the mail comes out of the shooter. You scan and find the floor each piece is moving to. Put her in the canister and shove her up the tube with the same number, got it?
BUDDY
Yeah! I like tubes and cannisters and numbers. This place reminds me of Santa's workshop. Except here it smells like mushrooms and everyone wants to hurt me.
INT. CONVERENCE ROOM - DAY
It's a writer's meeting. The three writers: EUGENE, HUSKEY and MORRIS sit around a table with Walter.
WALTER
So, we've got Greenway coming in tomorrow. Where are we at?
EUGENE
Well, Huskey and I were brain storming and we came up with what I think is a pretty big idea.
HUSKEY
You're going to love this.
MORRIS
I heard it already and I think it's fantastic.
WALTER
(pleasantly surprised)
Okay, great. Let's hear it.
HUSKEY
Picture this...
(long dramatic pause)
We bring in Miles Finch.
WALTER
The Miles Finch?
EUGENE
(excited)
The Golden Ghost.
HUSKEY
We bring him in.
MORRIS
He's written more classics than Dr. Seuss. It may not be easy, but we think it's worth a shot.
WALTER
So, lemme get this straight. You guys are pitching me the idea of another writer?
EUGENE
Yeah.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch.
Walter looks like he's about to get angry...but then:
WALTER
I like it.
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - MAIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
This is Buddy at his best. He stuffs and launches mail into tubes with incredible speed and efficiency. No one's ever seen anything like it.
Almost without noticing, Buddy begins singing to himself.
BUDDY
(singing)
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
He feels Trey's stares and catches himself. He turns to find a stone cold killer glare.
TREY
(beat)
A partridge in a pear tree.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Walter and the writers are huddled around a speaker phone.
EUGENE
My favorite book of yours has to be Gus' Pickles. It was existential, yet so accessible.
HUSKEY
It's a thrill just to be talking to you on our speaker phone.
WALTER
So what do you think? Can you fly in tomorrow morning?
A beat, and then Miles Finch's voice comes over the speaker phone, mysterious and brilliant.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
(intercom)
I'll give you five hours tomorrow, not a minute more.
WALTER
(relieved)
Great.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'd like a black S-500 to receive me at the airport. I need the interior of that car to be 71 degrees.
WALTER
We can do that.
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom; BEEP!)
Walter! There's a situation downstairs.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'm sorry, what? Hello?
WALTER
(in panic)
Deb, hang up! Miles stay on!
MILES FINCH
I do not hold! Do not put me on hold!
DEB (O.S.)
We have a problem in the mail room.
HUSKEY
What's going on?
WALTER
(pointing to Huskey)
Do not talk!
(into phone)
Deb, please hang up!
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
That's it, I'm gone!
WALTER
MILES! WAIT!
Dramatic pause. Is he gone?
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'll be there tomorrow.
(phew!)
71 degrees...
He clicks off.
DEB (O.S.)
Sir, Chuck in the mail room.
WALTER
Okay, okay! I'm going to the stupid mail room!
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Buddy's singing has spread like wild fire. The whole mailroom is now singing a beautiful rendition of THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS. Everyone is circled around, cheering and singing.
TREY
Eleven-pipers-piping...
CRAIG
Ten-lords-a-leaping...
LAZY-EYED CREEP
Nine-ladies-dancing...
GANG BANGER
Eight-maids-milking...
TREY
Six-geese-a-laying...
EVERYBODY
FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!!!
REVEAL
Walter is watching this display. The workers begin to notice Walter standing. One by one, they stop, until Buddy is left to continue alone.
BUDDY
(as he squat-thrusts)
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love...gave...to...
Buddy notices his dad and smiles. Walter does not.
EXT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy walks up to the buzzer panel until he finds the name Jovie Davis.
He presses the buzzer BRRR!!!! It scares the hell out of him. He jumps back and is then frightened to death as he is confronted by the sight of a display window full of Chinese roasted ducks. Still sporting heads. Jovie steps out.
BUDDY
(taking her in)
You look miraculous.
JOVIE
Miraculous? Thanks.
(they start walking)
So what do you feel like doing?
BUDDY
I have a few ideas.
JOVIE
Well, I'm up for anything.
BUDDY
Really?
JOVIE
Sure.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
Jovie sits blind-folded at the counter as Buddy sets up a cup of coffee before her.
BUDDY
Don't look. Just reach out and take a sip.
JOVIE
(smiles)
What are you doing?
She takes a sip.
BUDDY
Well?
JOVIE
It tastes like a crappy cup of coffee.
BUDDY
Ha ha.
He removes the blindfold.
JOVIE
It is a crappy cup of coffee.
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is running around and around a revolving door. Loving every moment.
Jovie watches, confused. Smirking slightly as OTHERS wait and grow annoyed with him.
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
Buddy pulls her by the arm.
BUDDY
Check out the size of this...
He shows her a pine tree decorated for Christmas.
BUDDY
Can you believe it?
JOVIE
(nonplussed)
Come with me.
EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - LATER
Jovie leads him around the corner.
REVEAL:
ROCKEFELLER CENTER. Buddy sees the GIANT CHRISTMAS TREE for the first time.
BUDDY
Wow, that looks wondrous.
They share their first genuine smile.
EXT. ICE RINK - LATER
Buddy and Jovie are skating, having fun. Jovie accidentally slides, BUMPING BUDDY. Buddy bumps her back. She bumps him back harder. It escalates until she checks him off of his feet. THEY FALL to the ice together, Jovie on top, nose to nose.
They look into each other's eyes and Buddy abruptly plants a kiss on Jovie's cheek.
BUDDY
Sorry.
JOVIE
You missed.
BUDDY
I missed?
JOVIE
Yeah.
With that, She leans in and kisses him full on the mouth. Buddy's hear fills his whole chest.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY
Walter and the writers sit in silence, waiting. Walter checks his watch. Still waiting.
HUSKEY
I sure hope that car's seventy one degrees.
EXT. MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS
The door swings open with a purpose:
REVEAL
Buddy. The morning after. Steps into the door frame like ELVIS. A changed man. WE follow him down the street. Buddy's not skipping, he's SKIPPING.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the writer's continue to wait. Nervous hand wringing.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
We see only the shoes of the infamous Miles Finch march through the company, echoing throughout the halls.
We see some of the workers' reactions.
This is epic.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
More nervous waiting.
EUGENE
I should have brought my camera.
More silence...and then:
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
Alright. Let's do this.
REVEAL
Miles Finch is FOUR FEET TALL. He may be very small, but in this business, he is a monster.
WALTER
Miles! Thanks so much for coming. We're all big fans. I'm Walter. We spoke on the phone.
MILES FINCH
Yeah, yeah. Great. Let's get the uh --
(i.e. Cash)
Taken care of so we can get started.
Walter pulls out a small manila envelope stacked with cash and slides it across the table. The three other writers watch it slide across, moving their heads like a tennis match, until Miles stops it with his hand.
Miles checks the money and tucks it into his vest pocket.
MILES FINCH
Okay, cool.
(right to the point)
So what have you guys got so far?
WALTER
(to Huskey)
Go ahead.
HUSKEY
(nervous)
Okay, well, we were thinking something like this: we open on a young Tomato. He's been through some tough times on the farm.
MILES FINCH
No tomatoes. Too vulnerable. Kids are already vulnerable.
WALTER
That's what we were kind of thinking.
MILES FINCH
And no farms, everyone's pushing small-town rural. Any farm book will just be white noise.
WALTER
Okay. Well, we don't have much time. Do you have any ideas?
MILES FINCH
I've got five or six strong starts. I'm sure we can put something very solid together. No problem.
(Walter is very happy)
There's one idea I'm especially psyched about. It's one of those ideas where you're just like YES!
WALTER
What is it?!
MILES FINCH
I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
BUDDY (O.S.)
Dad!
Walter is still fixated on Miles, waiting for his golden ticket. Finally he snaps out of it and looks at Buddy.
BUDDY
I'm in love! I'm in love! And I don't care who knows it!
WALTER
Not now, Buddy. Why don't you go...uh, back to the pit? I'll come visit you later, okay?
Buddy goes to leave, but before he does, he NOTICES A FOUR FOOT TALL MILES FINCH.
BUDDY
(looking at little Miles)
You didn't tell me you had Elvises working here!
MILES FINCH
(icy stare)
Boy you are hilarious, my friend.
WALTER
So what are you saying, Miles? Let's get back to the book.
MILES FINCH
(back on track)
Okay, at the top of the cover is the title, et this, ready? A --
BUDDY
Boy, the candy canes here in New York just don't measure up to Elf standards, do they?
MILES FINCH
(another icy stare)
Gee whiz, we're all laughing our butts off.
WALTER
Buddy! Please. Just go in the basement!
BUDDY
Do you guys have an Elf hockey league here? I'm just curious.
MILES FINCH
Hey, jack weed. I may be ""little,"" but I get more action in a week than you've had your whole life. I've got houses in LA, Hawaii, Vail and Paris, with a seventy inch plasma screen in each one of them. So I suggest you wipe that friggin' smile off your face before I bite it off.
(leaning in)
You feelin' strong, friend? Call me ELF one more time.
BUDDY
(to his Dad)
Boy, he's an angry Elf.
Miles suddenly ATTACKS! Buddy tries to avoid him, but Miles is surprisingly strong, flipping Buddy over the table.
Now out of nowhere, Buddy winds up like Popeye and decks him across the face. Buddy looks at his own fist in horror.
BUDDY
(looking at his fist)
What have I done?
This gives Miles permission to deliver five QUICK HOCKEY PUNCHES to the face. Buddy is down for the count.
Miles stands, victorious and grabs his coat.
MILES FINCH
All of you can kiss my vertically challenged ass.
Miles takes the envelope of money out of his jacket and pretends to toss it on the table, pump faking. Then returns it to his vest pocket and walks out.
WALTER
Miles! Wait!
BUDDY
(to himself)
A South Pole Elf.
Buddy rubs his chin and stands to face his father.
BUDDY
You're really red.
WALTER
DAMMIT BUDDY! THIS TIME YOU REALLY DID IT! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!
BUDDY
(scared)
Where do you want me to go?
WALTER
Go anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!
This one stings hard. Buddy runs off, upset like never before.
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
QUICK CUTS
Buddy walking through the city, devastated.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter is stressed, rubbing his face, pulling his hair out, on the phone. He's losing his career, and now he knows he's hurt Buddy.
WALTER
(into phone)
I can't really talk right now.
INT. EMILY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
INTERCUT with Emily.
EM
You're gonna be home for dinner, aren't you? I mean it is Christmas Eve.
WALTER
It looks like it's gonna be a late one.
EM
Oh. Do you wanna send Buddy home early?
WALTER
(riddled with guilt)
Oh, um, we'll talk about it later. I gotta go, okay?
Suddenly the three writers rush in. Walter hangs up.
HUSKEY
Walter! Huge news. The cleaning man just found this!
WALTER
What is it?
Huskey hands over a black journal and Walter flips through it.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch's notebook! He left it in the conference room. There's three great pitches in the first page alone!
MORRIS
Plus we've got his doodle-squiggles all over the back cover! We're not sure what they mean, but they're probably gold!
HUSKEY
I say we o with the first pitch in there! It's a slam dunk!
EUGENE
I agree, a home run.
MORRIS
Monster.
WALTER
How much time do we have?
HUSKEY
Forty-five.
WALTER
Let's get some story boards ready.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy steps out of the closet...
REVEAL
He's wearing his ELF SUIT again. Never before has an Elf looked so sad.
Buddy sits at the table and unfurls some long paper. He dips a quill pen in to some ink and writes in PERFECT CALLIGRAPHY.
WE HEAR BUDDY'S VOICE AS HE WRITES.
BUDDY (V.O.)
I'm sorry I ruined your lives... And crammed eleven cookies into the VCR. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. I will never forget you. Love, Buddy.
Buddy sets down the scroll, and now, as if sealing it, sets his SNOW GLOBE down on the crease.
Buddy walks out into the night.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
In his Elf Suit, Buddy trudges through the stormy New York night. The wind viciously blows. Buddy walks against it, the snow blowing into him.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - LATER
Michael comes home, carrying a bunch of presents. He looks around the empty house.
MICHAEL
Buddy?
INT. GREENWAY PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
Fulton Greenway and his crew sit at the end of the conference room, looking sharp as a tack. Walter is at the other end, looking even sharper.
GREENWAY
As you know, we need a big launch, fast. To get this company back on track. So, I think I speak for my fellow board members when I say...
(dramatic pause)
This better be good.
Walter smiles, then re-checks his storyboards, beaming.
WALTER
I'm confident, sir. You will not be disappointed.
GREENWAY
Let's hear it.
WALTER
My pleasure. I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Dad?!
Walter turns.
His son Michael is standing in the room.
WALTER
Michael?
MICHAEL
Buddy left!
WALTER
What?
Michael holds up the calligraphy scroll Buddy wrote. Everyone is confused.
MICHAEL
He wrote this note! He left his snow globe! He's gone!
WALTER
Okay, listen. Let me finish this meeting and we'll figure this out. Okay?
MICHAEL
Finish your meeting?!
(beat)
How'd I know you were going to say that?
Michael turns to leave, furious. Walter is torn...
WALTER
Michael! Wait!
Michael stops in his tracks, giving his dad a chance. Hopeful.
WALTER
(to the board)
Mr. Greenway, we have to reschedule this.
GREENWAY
We don't have time to reschedule! I want to hear the damn thing NOW!
(to Michael)
Son, this has to wait.
WALTER
No it doesn't. We'll do this some other time, Mr. Greenway.
GREENWAY
This isn't happening. You're going to sit in that chair and pitch me a hit friggin' book! NOW!
WALTER
Mr. Greenway, with all due respect, KISS MY ASS!
MICHAEL
Kiss my ass, too!!
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael walk down the hall, triumphantly, together.
GREENWAY (O.S.)
(in the distance)
If you walk out, Hobbs, you can never come back to Greenway!
EXT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
Buddy's on the bridge, looking down. Contemplating the worst of all possible conclusions. WAVES crash and churn far below.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael are walking fast, searching, half-jogging. Losing hope. Where's Buddy?
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy closes his eyes tight, then looks up, a tear streams down his cheek.
SUDDENLY SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE.
A distant point with a glowing trail of smoke. Buddy narrows his eyes to see as the point grows as it approaches. It slowly reveals itself to be SANTA'S SLEIGH!
Tangled with reindeer, fish-tailing, and CRASHING!
BUDDY
Santa?!
EXT. MANHATTAN - MEANWHILE
Walter is facing away from the park, in the sky behind him is the diving sled. Michael sees this all. His face is aglow.
MICHAEL
Oh...My...God!
WALTER
(missing it; turning)
What was that?!
In shock, without a word, Michael takes off running toward the park.
WALTER
What happened?
(running after him)
Michael, wait up!?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, running, frantic, comes upon Santa's SLEIGH in the distance. The reindeer peacefully graze as Santa struggles with the smoking sleigh. The landing looks to have been rough as the sleigh has dug a deep fifty foot long trench in the snow and dirt.
Santa frantically attempts to repair the problem with his head hidden under a hood panel. Smoke rises.
BUDDY
Santa!
Santa jumps out from under the hood clutching a TIRE IRON.
SANTA
Back off slick!!!
He then recognizes him.
SANTA
Buddy?? Is that you?
BUDDY
Are you okay?
SANTA
Boy am I glad to see you. The Claus-o-meter suddenly dropped down to zero. There's almost no Christmas Spirit in New York. The strain was too much, the engine broke free of her mounts. I need an Elf's help.
BUDDY
But I'm not an Elf, Santa. I can't do anything right.
SANTA
Buddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I've ever met, and the only one who I would have working on my sleight.
BUDDY
Really?
SANTA
Really. Will you fix the engine for me, Buddy?
BUDDY
I will. Papa taught me how.
SANTA
You'll have to find it first, she dropped off back there a ways.
Buddy runs off into the woods.
INT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Jovie walks out of the kitchen as NEW YORK ONE drones quietly on the TV. IT features a breaking NEWS STORY set in CENTRAL PARK. A REMOTE REPORTER is on the scene.
REMOTE REPORTER
New York One has been unable to confirm anything, but it's obvious that something has happened in Central Park. Authorities are clearing out the park and all entrances have been barricaded. As you can see, quite a crowd is starting to gather.
The camera pans and we see a huge crowd is gathering outside Central Park, held back by barricades and police.
The female reporter steps over to a Latino man, who holds his 5-year old son in his arms.
REMOTE REPORTER
Sir, you say you were able to get a first-hand look at what happened? Tell me, what did you see?
LATINO MAN
I was walking along, and I saw a huge flash, and then something came swooping down...
REMOTE REPORTER
Something? Do you mean an airplane or a helicopter?
LATINO MAN
It wasn't like that. IT sounds crazy, but it looked like, uh...
He's too embarrassed.
LATINO CHILD
It was Santa's Sleigh!
REMOTE REPORTER
(dismissive)
Aren't you a cutie.
(listening to earpiece)
This could be a big hoax. I'm now told we have some amateur footage of a strange man dressed as an Elf. Let's take a look.
ON THE SCREEN
A zoomed-in blurry image of Buddy running. He trips and falls on his face like an idiot. Then scrambles up and runs into the woods. Sort of like that old Big Foot Footage, if he had done a face plant. It ends in a freeze frame of Buddy's FACE as he looks over a shoulder.
They re-play the footage over and over and over again.
JOVIE
(seeing Buddy)
Oh my God.
EXT. ENGINE SITE - CENTRAL PARK -
CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael stop at a smoking object in the snow. It's SANTA'S MISSING ENGINE.
WALTER
What the...
BUDDY (O.S.)
You found it!
Michael and Walter look up to see Buddy approaching them. Michael runs to him with a hug.
MICHAEL
Buddy! You're here!
BUDDY
(in a hurry)
There's something I've got to tell you guys!
WALTER
(ignoring; focused)
No. Me first. There's something I want to tell you right now! I take back everything I said. You may be a little...how do you say... chemically imbalanced. But you've been right about a lot of things. I promise you, I'm going to be making some changes in my life. I don't want you to leave... I need you. You're my son and I love you.
They hug. This means more Buddy than anyone could ever know.
SANTA (O.S.)
(from a foggy distance)
Buddy?! How are we looking?? We gotta move!
WALTER
Who was that?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy leads them to the clearing. Pulling back a tree branch to reveal:
TRUTH
Santa's GROUNDED SLEIGH and nine grazing reindeer. Shocked awe.
MICHAEL
(can barely speak)
Cool...
Walter cannot yet deal with this reality. His eyes getting wider and wider...about to faint?
TV COVERAGE - CONTINUOUS
REMOTE REPORTER
Dick, according to authorities, the area has been cleared. Only the Central Park Rangers remain in the park.
EXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
TRACKING CLOSE UP OF HOOVES
All lined up along a ridge. FOUR BLACK MARES breathe steam into the night air. Their RIDERS are silently staring into the night. They wear black leather boots and trench coats.
Chrome helmets sit atop faces shrouded in shadow. A silver eagle badge reads CENTRAL PARK RANGERS. They look down upon the sleigh, quite a distance away.
REMOTE REPORTER (V.O.)
These forces are highly trained, but rarely see action. Some have accused them of being too ""gung ho"" when called into duty. And their crowd control tactics at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85 were much criticized.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
JOVIE IS RUNNING down the street, heading into Central Park.
EXT. GREAT LAWN - CONTINUOUS
Buddy works on the engine while Walter and Michael try to wake up from this strange dream.
MICHAEL
So...you're...real?
SANTA
(re: sleigh; working)
Hold this for a sec.
WALTER
This is not happening.
Walter and Michael, stunned, hold the hood up.
MICHAEL
Buddy's really an Elf?
BUDDY
Actually, I'm adopted.
MICHAEL
I can't believe it.
SANTA
Tell me, what did you want for Christmas, Michael?
MICHAEL
I wanted a skateboard.
Santa pulls out a scroll. He points to his name in calligraphy on a THICK LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.
It's THE LIST.
SANTA
(verifying)
Not just a skateboard, a Real Huf Board with high 145 Thunder Trucks. 52 millimeter Spitfire Classic Wheels and bolts from Diamond and some Swiss Bearings.
In this moment, Walter and Michael both really believe.
ECU
We see the CLAUS-O-METER move up a little.
The sleigh SHUDDERS and RISES, then falls to the ground.
MICHAEL
What happened?
SANTA
Before our Viper engine days, this thing used to run solely on Christmas Spirit. You two believe in me. You made my sleigh fly.
MICHAEL
They fly away! Quick! Before they catch you!
SANTA
I wish I could. I'm afraid I need more than the Spirit of just you two.
MICHAEL
Hold it. If you're really Santa, we can just get the news cameras in here and everyone will believe in you, then your sleigh will fly, right?
SANTA
Christmas Spirit is about believing, not seeing. If the whole world saw me, all would be lost. The paparazzi have been after me for years.
Michael spots the RANGERS on the crest in the distance.
MICHAEL
Look!
They all look up in fear as the riders disappear into the woods. Buddy pulls Walter aside. Michael follows.
BUDDY
Santa needs your help.
MICHAEL
But, what can we do?
BUDDY
I got an idea.
He whispers a PLAN to Walter and Michael.

Michael SNATCHES the LIST from Santa and runs into the woods.
SANTA
My List!
Buddy stops Santa from chasing. He takes command.
BUDDY
Santa, let him go. You'll get it back. Now, listen to me. I need you to give Walter your hat and coat.
SANTA
But Mrs. Claus made them for me...
WALTER
Hurry! Do you have any idea what would happen to Santa Clause in prison?!
Santa complies and Walter dons the over-sized ensemble.

REMOTE REPORTER spots Michael running out of the trees.
REMOTE REPORTER
A young boy has just come running out of the park...Let me see if I can get a comment...
(to Michael)
Did you see anything?
MICHAEL
It's the real Santa! His sleigh can't fly cause nobody believes in him!
REMOTE REPORTER
(blowing him off)
Now, this is feeling more and more like some kind of elaborate Christmas hoax.
MICHAEL
This isn't a stunt. It's true! Everyone out there, Santa needs us to believe! I can prove he's real. This is Santa's LIST!
He pulls out the LIST and reads:
MICHAEL
Lynn Kessler wants a Powerpuff Girls play set! Mark Webber wants an electric guitar!
SERIES OF CUTS TO:
Lynn and Mark. Each with their eyes wide open, believing, giving Santa power.

CAROLYN

I'm Charlotte Dennon.
MICHAEL
Lemme see. Charlotte Dennon wants a ""Tiffany engagement ring, and for your boyfriend to stop dragging his feet and commit already!""
Off the Reporter's look, we...
SMASH CUT TO:
The SURGE IN CHRISTMAS SPIRIT makes Santa's Sleigh RISE A FOOT OFF THE GROUND. We see the gauge go forward a bit.
SANTA
We got power!
Santa snaps the reigns. The sleigh starts to lumber forward. Buddy still struggles with the engine under the sleigh.
BUDDY
I don't have the engine fixed yet!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The reporter stands speechless as the ANCHORMAN talks into her earpiece...
INT. NEW YORK ONE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
The Anchorman is confused.
ANCHORMAN
Charlotte? Charlotte? We seem to be having some technical difficulty with our remote unit. Now for weather on the ones...
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The Reporter stands staring at Michael as the lights are TURNED OFF on the remote unit.
MICHAEL
No!
REMOTE REPORTER
(stunned)
How did you know that?
MICHAEL
I'm telling you, it's Santa! We have to get the cameras back on! He needs our help!
This giant scene at the barricades has gone dark. The crowd offers scattered boos. Emily consoles Michael.
CROWD (O.S.)
Let the kid read! What do I want?!
The crowd stands around, confused. Jovie runs up to Michael and Emily, winded.
JOVIE
Where's Buddy?!
MICHAEL
He's with Santa. The sleigh won't fly. No one's believing! We need to get these cameras back on!
Jovie looks around. Trying to think of a plan. Inspired, she climbs atop a horse's carriage and looks out over the crowd. She's intimidated.
JOVIE
(to herself)
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear...
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Walter, standing watch, sees the MOUNTED POLICE CHARGING.
WALTER
Get out of here! They're coming! There's enough Christmas spirit to start moving!
Buddy jumps in. The sleigh slowly hovers forward a foot off the ground, in a herky-jerky way. The MOUNTED RIDERS come at Walter who wears Santa's hat and coat. He attempts to be a decoy.
WALTER
Hey! I'm right here! Ho ho ho! You got me! I surrender!
They ride right past him and after the sleigh.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Santa swerve past trees, scraping bark and smashing branches. Santa catches a glimpse over his shoulder of the Rangers in hot pursuit.
SANTA
Grab the shot gun under the seat and give 'em some heat!
BUDDY
What?!
SANTA
A joke, Buddy. Lighten up! Listen, there's barely enough magic to make this thing move. Keep working on the engine!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
Above the huge crowd that has gathered at the barricade, we see Jovie standing on top of a car roof. Timidly, she begins singing, her sweet voice cracking with fear.
JOVIE
You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout. I'm telling you why...
Walter finally arrives. He joins his family, watching Jovie.
WALTER
(to Emily)
He wasn't lying.
EMILY
Merry Christmas.
They hug.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, risking his life, working on the engine at high speed. Smoke and sparks billow out. Santa struggles to maintain control. They hit a bump and some toys fly out of the back.
A Jack in the Box rattles by Buddy, POPPING OPEN.
BUDDY
Ah!
They find themselves blocked by a giant FOUNTAIN with the Rangers close behind.
BUDDY
I've almost got it!
SANTA
We need power, now!
Buddy tweaks the engine. It HOWLS TO LIFE and the urge of power BLOWS THE SLEIGH FORTY FEET INTO THE AIR, clearing the fountain.
BUDDY
(in triumph)
YES!! I DID IT!! I'M THE GREATEST ADOPTED ELF IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!
SANTA
Good job, Buddy!
But now the belly of the coach nails the winged statue atop the fountain, yanking the whole engine back out of the sleigh. YOINK! The machine whirls and shoots off the trees. The engineless sleigh crashes down to the bricks.
SANTA
That's it. With no engine, we're toast.
CUT TO:
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
JOVIE
He sees you when you're sleeping...
Emily is the first to join in. And now Michael sings too. And now some others...
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Still with some Spirit power, the sleigh scrapes along the paved mall, sending sparks showering into the night air as the horses close in.
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The WHOLE CROWD sings. The Remote Reporter sees this and puts her finger to her earpiece.
REMOTE REPORTER
(to the studio)
Dick, come back to remote 3. I think I've got something here.
JOVIE & THE CROWD
He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake...
CAMERAS TURN BACK ON.
REMOTE TRUCK'S LIGHTS POP BACK ON. Again, the scene is aglow.
REMOTE REPORTER
(into cameras)
Charlotte Dennon, back at Central Park. Although we're still unclear about what led to this holiday rally, hundreds of New Yorkers have spontaneously gathered together and broken out into song. A curious Christmas Eve, to say the least. Let's listen in...
BRIEF CUTS AROUND THE CITY
The Broadcast is being watched...
- We see the MAILROOM guys in A bar singing along in perfect harmony.
- the THREE WRITERS are singing.
- the DOCTOR is singing.
- the GUARDS from the Empire State Building are singing.
- the TEENAGERS who threw snowballs sing.
- the ELF MANAGER from Gimbels sings with co-workers.
ELF MANAGER
(as his friends sing)
Do what you want, I ain't singing a damn thing.
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Santa's sleigh is being rail-roaded. Right into the barricades. No steering, no lift...up in the distance, we see they are headed for a collision.
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
As Emily and Michael sing along, Michael looks up at Walter and notices something peculiar. He busts his father.
MICHAEL
Wait! You're NOT singing!
WALTER
Yes I am.
MICHAEL
No you're not. You're just moving your lips.
WALTER
Michael! Please, I have a terrible voice.
MICHAEL
Dad!!!
Then, in spite of himself, WALTER BELTS OUT THE CHORUS in such an awful voice, it draws looks from the singers around him. As the bad notes rise into the chilly night air...
WALTER
(terrible)
Santa Claus is coming to town!
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Walter's singing somehow does the trick. The CLAUS-O-METER shoots to the MAX!
A dash light BLINKS ""HO HO HO"" as the gauge hits the red zone. Santa howls in approval. The SLEIGH flies up into the night air and over the barricade, reporters and on-lookers. The rangers slide to a stop, foiled at last.
As the shadow of the sleigh zips high over them, the whole crowd joins in, singing their hearts out. Jovie can't believe it. She sings even stronger.
A VOICE BOOMS OUT from a mysterious silhouette into the magical winter night...
SANTA
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!
Santa's sleigh whips down Sixth Ave. and into the Manhattan night sky. And silhouettes against the moon.
FREEZE FRAME
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And so, with a little help, Buddy managed to save Christmas.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS DAY
Walter, Michael, Buddy, Emily and Jovie sit happily gathered around their Christmas tree. Wrapping paper everywhere.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And his spirit saved a lot of other people, too. It was quite a Christmas, and quite a New Year.
INT. WALTER'S NEW COMPANY - DAY
Walter is stenciling the name 'HOBB'S PUBLISHING'.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter started his own independent publishing company. His first book was written by a brand new critically acclaimed children's author...
INT. GIMBELS - DAY
The 'ELF' book from the beginning of the movie is Buddy's. He's doing a book signing. The place is packed.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
The book was called 'Elf'. A fictional story about an adopted Elf named Buddy who was raised in the North Pole. Went to New York, ate spaghetti, worked in a shiny mail room and eventually saved Christmas.
Buddy and Walter ice skate together at Rockefeller Center in the middle of the night.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And every year, on Christmas day, after all the presents are opened by children around the world, Buddy and his Dad make up for lost time...
Buddy still tries to hold his hand. Walter slaps it away.
INSERT
We see an Elfish hand applying white out to Walter's name on the List.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter even made the jump from 'naughty' to 'nice'.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - DAY
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And, as for me, I can't complain. Buddy comes up to visit from time to time.
RAPID FIRE FINALE OF BUDDY SLAMMING HIS HEAD INTO DOORWAYS, BEAMS AND CABINETS.
BUDDY
Ow! Yikes! Golly! Charles Dickens! Sone of a Gnome! Fiddlesticks! Snow Flickers!
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
Jovie, in real Elf clothes, sets a pitcher of milk in front of Papa Elf. She sits beside Buddy who cradles a NEWBORN BABY in his arms wearing a pink Elf hat that says SUSIE.
This is the last image of the movie and also the last image of the book. It freezes and now becomes a drawing and we pull out to see it's the last page of Buddy's ELF book, which magically flips closed.
We're back in the bookstore from the very first scene. A little kid grabs the book out of the window.
FADE TO BLACK.

Una aventura es más divertida si huele a peligro

Si te invito a una copa y me acerco a tu boca
Si te robo un besito, a ver, ¿te enojas conmigo?
¿Qué dirías si esta noche te seduzco en mi coche?
Que se empañen los vidrios y la regla es que goces
Si te falto el respeto y luego culpo al alcohol
Si levanto tu falda, ¿me darías el derecho a medir tu sensatez?
Poner en juego tu cuerpo
¿Sí te parece prudente esta propuesta indecente?

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then
 I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout 
that

I'll be in the grey Cadillac

[Strofa 1]
Ho bisogno adesso di un sogno
In questa strada in cui mi ricordo
Ora è buio ed è vuoto intorno
E alla fine sai che non dormo
Ma ho paura che possa perdersi
Questo vivere, sa confonderci, oh
Ho bisogno di una risposta
Sole che esca nella tempesta
Non rinchiuderti in una stanza
E trova fuori la tua certezza
Ma ho paura che possa perdersi
Questo vivere, sa confonderci
[Ritornello]
Ho bisogno di amarti
Ma non come vuoi tu
Completare i tuoi gesti
Spegnerti la TV
Questo senso di niente
Passa se ci sei tu
Quanto costa averti dentro
È come l'immenso
È lo stesso e il diverso
Tutto questo sei tu"

[Intro]
Hoy no voy a salir y voy a quedarme en la' nube' donde nadie sube
[Estribillo]
(Uah) No vengas a molestar, dicen que está todo mal‚ bueno
(Uah) Yo estoy más que bien acá y no te pienso ni mirar‚ ciego
Vamo'‚ repriman la mierda que tienen guardada en el pecho
Traguen y callen hasta estar desecho', párense siempre derecho
""Cállenlo, sédenlo‚ que haga lo que quiera, pero sáquenlo"" y
""Cállenlo, sédenlo‚ que haga lo que quiera, pero sáquenlo""
Ey, háganme caso, ¿o no tienen claro que soy el rey?
Háganme caso que soy la ley, dame mis blíster', mis Parisiennes, wah
[Verso]
Patada de canguro, golpe duro
No vamo' a parar con esto, negro, te lo juro
Traje cianuro pa' meterle' en el trago
Cinco minuto' acá y ya estamo' causando estragos
Un mago nos quiere hacer desaparecer
Pero esta plaga rara nunca para de crecer
Somo' de los pocos locos que andan buscando placer
Y aunque quieran vernos roto', no damo' brazo a torcer
No para de toser, trabajando doce hora'
Cobra dos moneda' al mes pa' mantener cuatro persona'
Y no hables de meritocracia, me da gracia, no me joda'
Que sin oportunidades esa mierda no funciona
Y no, no hace falta gente que labure más
Hace falta que con menos se pueda vivir en paz
Mandale gas, no te perdás, acordate dónde estás
Fijate siempre de qué lado de la mecha te encontrás
Dice: ""What up? Esto pega como coca""
La gente baila loca, el cuello se disloca
La droga en lo' dedo', que vaya de boca en boca
Sentís como te choca, esa vaina subió la nota
Salto como una pulga, empezó la purga
Largo todo fresco como un PXXR GVNG, hijo de—
Otra vez con sed entre fiebres y migraña'
Vuelvo a soñar con un viejo en el medio de una montaña
Me miró y me dijo: ""De la vida nadie se salva
Y eso de la juventud es solo una actitud del alma""
Qué virtud extraña, ahora me queman las entrañas
Mi mejor conversación la tuve ayer con una araña
No sé qué hora es, ni me interesa
Acá siempre son 4:20, y estamo' de la cabeza
, con simpleza
Birra barata y mala en lata, má' la planta santa esa
La que calma el cuerpo y te lo desestresa
El hood está de fiesta, el culo se te tensa
Entiendo que te molesta, la empatía te cuesta
Y si ahora gritamo' y cantamo' en modo de protesta
Es porque preguntamo' bien y nadie nos dio una respuesta
Se creen dueños, salgan del medio, lo digo en serio
Fuera la yuta que meten al barrio, le tira a los pibe' y le mata los sueño'
Bueno, juego, del underground, del agujero
Estamo' agitando de nuevo, sacando pa' afuera a eso' carroñero', ñero"

Steh' hier wieder vor dei'm Eingang
Wollte fragen, ob ich reinkann

Ja, ich lieg' im Lamborghini drin
So lang gewartet, bis dieses Spiel beginnt
Und der Mensch in meinem Spiegelbild
War nie sehr beliebt, weil er immer gleich geblieben ist
Sag, warum willst du schon los ohne mich?

Ich hab' zu viel Zeit auf den Straßen verschwendet

None with a level on the vine
Nobody out of it is worth, hey
""No reason to get excited"", the thief he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate, so let us stop talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
All along the watchtower, princess kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance, a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl"

Porque siempre quiero más de ti
Yo quisiera hacerte más feliz
Hoy, mañana, siempre, hasta el fin
Mi corazón estalla por tu amor
¿Y tú qué crees? ¿Que esto es muy normal?
Acostumbrado estás tanto al amor
¿Que no lo ves? Yo nunca he estado así
Si de casualidad
Me ves llorando un poco
Es porque yo te quiero a ti
[Coro: Natalia Lafourcade]
Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Todas las ilusiones vagabundas que se dejan alcanzar
Y no verás que lo que yo te ofrezco es algo incondicional
Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Te enredas por las noches, entre historias que nunca tienen final
Te perderás dentro de mis recuerdos por haberme hecho llorar
[Verso 2: Natalia Lafourcade]
Nunca es suficiente para mí
Porque siempre quiero más de ti
No ha cambiado nada mi sentir
Aunque me haces mal, te quiero aquí
Mi corazón estalla de dolor
¿Cómo evitar que se fracture en mil?
Acostumbrado estás tanto al amor
¿Que no lo ves? Yo nunca he estado así
Si de casualidad
Me ves llorando un poco
Es porque yo te quiero a ti"

Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy
 and sometimes life can be deceiving

But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too

too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene

Of their own phony concoction
We coat it in frost
Bringing the head-not lover
For the lonely and lot
In this wasteland
God saved the faceless spaceman
Writing revolution with spray cans
Forging soundscapes to escape
The famine with found objects
Expanding from the sleepiest towns
Down to projects
For better or worse
I put faith in alienation
The one sure source
Of freedom from frustration
Taking my time
I'm sure this is as good as it gets
Setting fire to my vinyl, CDs and cassettes
Killing the video star
With his pretty little car
Beat the rock and roll idol to death
With his guitar, the starving artist
Is heaven in in the cay (?)
Cause I hate the way we're living
But I love it that way
It give me something to say
And that's enough for today
Cause I'm too lazy to leave
But too stubborn to stay"

Mein Platz wurde von einer Sonnenbrille eingenommen, die nach einer Narbe fragt, und

Ich weiß, du versuchst zu vergessen
Aber zwischen den Drinks und den subtilen Dingen
Die Löcher in meinen Entschuldigungen
Du weißt, ich versuche hart, es zurückzunehmen

Und du dich fühlst als würdest du zusammenbrechen

They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around

Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined

See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

And I kinda miss my side
Know I shoulda listened when you told me the first time:
""You won't find another like me""
'Cause I'm sat here in my front room with a girl who ain't you
Hopin' and prayin' you're breakin' up with another fool
Who didn't hear the words that I hear on the same loop:
""You won't find another like me""
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I shoulda loved harder
Put up more of a fight
I know I could've been stronger tonight

I look for love, but there's a space inside my mind
Where I keep on missing you, I keep on missing you
If you've seen enough, know that I'll be right here
Now with somebody new, I keep on missing you
[Post-Chorus]
You, you
[Verse 2]
I learned every lesson, no more guessing
No more reasons why I should be reminiscing
Instead of saying how I feel (I feel)
Instead of running from what's real (Why)
'Cause I can't keep all this weight on my shoulders
I can't sleep while my bed's getting colder
Strip it back and underneath, I know
I'm scared you'll find another like me"

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)"

And now I lay myself down and hope I wake up young again

Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there

Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

That everyone else gets around

And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]
The King asked her, ""And what was their story?"" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroës of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyár Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sudán, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayhún and Jayhún,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of Cæsarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing""[FN#146]—a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, ""Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Makán and his sister Nuzhat al-Zamán.[FN#149] They answered ""Hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, ""O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afrídún,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Forty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, ""O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle."" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""Ye have delay of three days."" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""I hear and I obey;"" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, ""Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!"" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,
""Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters
            course through plain and wood:
No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all
            gifts, Giver of all good!""
And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,
""The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens
            debonnair:
Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-
           fair:
Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to
            ensnare;
And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of
            their hair:
Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond
          compare;
Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire."""

Yelling at the sky
Screaming at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I’m still your girl
Holding on too tight
Head up in the clouds
Heaven only knows where you are now
[Pre-Chorus]
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?
[Chorus]
I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
[Verse 2]
Never got the chance
To say your last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try"

Go!
[Verse 1]
So one, two, three
Take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine
I said, you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine
[Verse 2]
Oh, four, five, six
Come on and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya, honey?
[Pre-Chorus]
Big black boots, long brown hair
She's so sweet with her get-back stare
[Chorus]
Well, I could see you home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah"

[Intro]
Hitmaker
[Verso 1: MC Jottapê]
Me mandou embora da tua vida
Terminou comigo por mensagem
Vinte e quatro hora tu me liga
Com saudade da minha língua, querendo matar a vontade
[Refrão: MC Jottapê]
Que pena que acabou a gente
Mas já que tá com saudade
Vem sentando, vem sentando, vem sentando, vem
Se acabou o amor, que seja eterna a sacanagem
Que pena que acabou a gente
Mas já que tá com saudade
Vem sentando, vem sentando, vem sentando, vem
Se acabou o amor, que seja eterna a sacanagem
[Verso 2: MC Kekel]
Você meteu o pé tão decidida
Fiquei curtindo a brisa, mó suave
Bate a bad, corre pras amigas
Mas quando você quer liga
É na minha porta que tu bate"

668,Rise Up,Andra Day,74,Cheers To The Fall,2015-08-28,r&b,253342,"[Verse 1]
You're broken down and tired
Of living life on a merry-go-round
And you can't find the fighter
But I see it in you, so we gon' walk it out
And move mountains
We gon' walk it out
And move mountains
[Chorus]
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again
And I'll rise up, high like the waves
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again
[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you
[Verse 2]
When the silence isn't quiet
And it feels like it's getting hard to breathe
And I know you feel like dying
But I promise we'll take the world to its feet
And move mountains
Bring it to its feet
And move mountains"
669,Easily,Bruno Major,74,A Song For Every Moon,2017-08-31,r&b,210240,"[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
[Verse 1]
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know that they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
[Verse 2]
You might have tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
[Verse 3]
Coming and going
Inside out and back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me"

673,(Everything I Do) I Do It For You,Bryan Adams,74,Waking Up The Neighbours,1991-09-24,rock,393640,"[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
And when you find me there
You'll search no more
[Chorus]
Don't tell me
It's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me
It's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
[Verse 2]
Look into your heart
You will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am
Take my life
I would give it all
I would sacrifice"
674,It's Not Living (If It's Not With You),The 1975,74,A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,2018-11-30,rock,248336,"[Verse 1]
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation
[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination
[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you"

Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like
 (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear, yeah

I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet"

And watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Flood warning, Flocka yea
Blowin' fuck it I dont care
Dreads is flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like bruh
I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks
Oh fuckin' well
I'm tryna hit the hotel
With 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow
Moscato got her freaky
Hey you got me in a trance

Pussy pop on her handstand
You got me sweatin'
Please pass me a fan, damn!"

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad
[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me"

I'm beggin' of you, please
Don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just
Because you can
[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
[Verse 2]
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothin' I can do to keep
From cryin' when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene"

[Intro Instrumental]
[Verso 1: Gaby Moreno]
Fuiste tú
Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera
Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera
Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía
Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería
Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues
[Verso 2: Ricardo Arjona]
Fuiste tú
De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas
O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas
Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje
Las nubes grises también forman parte del paisaje
[Pre-Coro: Ricardo Arjona]
Y no me veas así
Si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú
[Coro: Ricardo Arjona & Gaby Moreno]
Qué fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque
Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece
Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte"

Tiritas pa' este corazón partío
 (Tiri-Tiri-Tirititando de frío)
Tiritas pa' este corazón partío
 (Pa' este corazón)
[Verso 1]
Ya lo ves, que no hay dos sin tres
Que la vida va y viene y que no se detiene, y qué sé yo
Pero miénteme aunque sea
Dime que algo queda entre nosotros dos
Que en tu habitación nunca sale el sol
Ni existe el tiempo ni el dolor
Llévame si quieres a perder
A ningún destino, sin ningún porqué
[Verso 2]
Ya lo sé, que corazón que no ve
Es corazón que no siente o corazón que te miente, amor
Pero sabes que en lo más profundo de mi alma sigue aquel dolor
Por creer en ti, ¿qué fue de la ilusión
Y de lo bello que es vivir?
[Pre-Coro]
¿Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herío?
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo el corazón partío"

Quizá no fue coincidencia encontrarme contigo

Sé que pronto estaré en tu camino

I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place

I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do"

[Intro: Júlio Sereno, 
LUDMILLA
]
Alô, Alô, Numanice
Ludmilla! Vamos cantar
Tá lindo, hein, caramba
[Verso 1: LUDMILLA, 
Júlio Sereno
]
Como eu pude um dia me apaixonar por você?
Sim
Como eu pude um dia (me envolver com alguém assim?)
Júlio, canta pra gente, Júlio
Tão diferente de mim
Tão nem aí pra sonhar
Por que tem que ser assim?
Bem que podia mudar
[Pré-Refrão: Júlio Sereno, 
LUDMILLA
]
Se é errando que se aprende
Eu aprendi com você
Eu aprendi com você
Só se sabe o que é bom
Quando conhece o ruim
Graças à Deus, 
Graças à Deus
Graças à Deus teve um fim
Viver sofrendo não dá
Faça um favor pra mim
Nem venha me
Procurar"
699,The Boys Are Back In Town,Thin Lizzy,74,Jailbreak (Deluxe Edition),1976,rock,266720,"[Verse 1]
Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy
[Chorus]
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
[Verse 2]
You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her"

I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes

[Verso 1]
Dame de tu vida y de tu tiempo
Suficientes para ver
Dentro de tus ojos el momento
Que me obligue a renacer
Dame vida y dame aliento
Que yo ya perdí el conocimiento
Sólo quédate un momento
Hasta evaporarnos en el viento
[Pre-Coro]
No hay motivos para decirnos adiós tan pronto
Sigo vivo créemelo mi amor no soy tan tonto
[Coro]
Si tú quisieras esta noche
Ir a bailar un chachachá
Yo te puedo enamorar
[Verso 2]
Dame de tu vida y de tu tiempo, oooh
Que te quiero conocer
Déjame sentir el movimiento, 
oooh
De tu cuerpo al florecer"

Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way

Never gave a fuck about what the teacher say, 'cause either way
I'mma just do me, and she said me too, I said ""S'il vous plaît""

Ain't no secret safe

Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back, she asks a million questions

Got my favorite girl waking up in my bed, it's only right
Bad bitch my only type, independent too, get it boo

And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door

Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on two-one and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks

Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another 
stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend 
hit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb

Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos

Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Und, dass sowas von sowas kommt
[Instrumental]
[Strophe 2]
99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur 99 Luftballons
[Strophe 3]
99 Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons"

So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails

You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?
 Oh

Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick

I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
[Chorus]
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

That salvation lets their wings unfold

Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street

And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand, woah
And then I let him go
Now there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK, hey-hey
Until I made my getaway
[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

They haunt me
 
like ghosts
They want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring, my, my
How the seasons go by
I get high and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll, you know
That's how the story goes"

Es tenerte encima mío y besarte la boca, yeh

I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom

Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (Mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on (Towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared (Way she stared)
And the way she said, ""You missed a spot over there"" (Spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy

Look, let me talk to 'em then, Sourmilk, look
They say it never come to fruition unless the vision is crafted
My drive is relentlessly, repetitiously mastered
Progress is positive, pessimism is backward
Since failure ain't attractive my next decision was drastic
I made it out of pitfalls strictly due to my passion
Supreme intellect, not to mention wisdom to match it
Name another nigga that put up 50 in practice
This shit is magic, even my exhibition is classic
Funny I ain't end up broke, like you predicted
There's a thousand niggas like you, no need to be too specific
I out-maneuver goofies like you with a few decisions
When the proof is missing you get reduced to a euphemism
Shit the truth is wicked, I just threw a surprise party
At a see-through mansion, my nigga, I'm stupid gifted
This voodoo mixed with, clear struggle and shear hustle
I'm trying to stretch ham, string me too long and I tear a muscle
Nigga where was you
When we was down and we slaved in kitchens
With my homie putting cut on that bird like it's Cajun chicken
I'm amazing, they parade but my crown wasn't made to fit 'em
You got signed off my signature style, that's plagiarism
I'm Miyagi with it, try to kick it like I can kick it?
You just begging to get buried alive, but I can dig it
Shit, copped a biscuit, mapped his block out and plot a visit

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
I say you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out
[Verse 2]
Well, I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out"

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
[Verse 2]
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drug
[Instrumental Break]

Oh, mothers, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun"

Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash
[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity
[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
[Verse 2]
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show"

I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
And just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mm, so here goes nothing
[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl, it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking"

Préndete en fuego como un lighter
Sacúdete el sudor como si fueras un wiper

Cambia esa cara de seria
Esa cara de intelectual de enciclopedia
Que te voy a inyectar con la bacteria
Pa' que de' vuelta' como machina de ferias

Que va a explotar como fiesta patronal
Que va a explotar como palestino
Yo sé que a ti te gusta el pop-rock latino
Pero es que el reggaeton se te mete por los intestino'
Por debajo de la falda como un submarino
Y te saca lo de indio taíno
Ya tú sabe', en taparrabo', mamá
En el nombre de Agüeybaná, no hay más na'

Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino

Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino
Hoy porque voy
Contra la fuerza de un submarino
A conquistar a esa dama que tanto juega conmigo
Voy por el mundo solo y sin amigos
Voy dando tantas vueltas sin ningún sentido
Pero tu ayer cambiaste mi destino
Me diste vida, mucha más vida que el vino
Me diste fuerza en los días fríos
Me diste ganas de extrañarte sin ningún motivo
Quiero encontrar otro camino 
ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en tu camino
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no"

Aí, se não for pedir muito
Pega um copo de café e um maço de cigarro
Pra eu ficar daqui só viajando
Olhando você pelada dando uns tragos
Sua cor reluz quando tá suada
Sua cara muda quando tá tarada
Me olhou por cima do ombro do nada
Imagina a posição que ela tava
E quem dera se você pudesse deixar eu desvendar um pouco do seu corpo
Sabe que nós não desiste nunca
Se não for nessa, nós pede de novo
E quem dera se você pudesse deixar eu desvendar um pouco do seu corpo
Deixa, deixa, deixa

Então deixa que vai dar bom
Nossa mistura na cama até merece um som
Plaqtududum no colchão
Ela falando baixinho: ""Vai, não para, não""

You got to breathe and have some fun

And I won't stop until I'm done

Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

This we must leave and get undone

And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one

We've got to dance and be in love

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

CUT TO: TAXI
Deadpool sits in the back of a taxi cab. He takes a pamphlet for ‘Haunted Segway Tours’, folds it up, and puts it in his pocket. He plays with the window. He puts his finger in some gum on the ceiling. He tries flicking it off, but it ends up on the camera lense. He picks it off. Cut to the taxi driver. Suddenly, Deadpool sticks his head up front.
DEADPOOL: Kinda lonesome back here.
He begins climbing up into the passenger seat, grunting.
DEADPOOL: Little help?
DOPINDER
: Sir, I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
DEADPOOL: Excuse me.
He finishes climbing into the seat and rights himself. The cabbie extends his hand.

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock and roll
[Verse 2]
Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock and roll
[Chorus]
Still like that old time rock and roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock and roll
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Won't go to hear 'em play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playin' old time rock and roll"
859,Easy,Mac Ayres,72,Drive Slow,2017-08-11,r&b,314358,"[Verse 1]
Oh, you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time
[Pre-Chorus]
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say
[Chorus]
I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand"

Biggest boss and I've been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver's not religious, the revolution’s born
You wanna know my name then go and tell the serg'
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake
Deadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy?
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it?
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun
[Hook: Instrumental]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin (Rozay!)
[Verse 2]
Don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide, boy
It's a time for games and it's a time to kill
Make up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do we do together
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I spend that every other month
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Build a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches
Say my name and I’m coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there’s only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came
Count money, drug residue, even blood on ‘em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it"

We go back and forth, we go back and forth
And it ain't good for me, what we do this for?
We go back and forth, won’t do this, no

Oh whoa
We go back and forth, we go back and forth
Oh whoa
We go back and forth, won’t do this, no

All, all we, all

You always leave me wondering, wondering
It's not as simple as you and me
Can never tell if I'm in love with him or lost with him"

Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me

Known from the dawn of time

[Verso 1]
Já pensou se eu tivesse parado?
Desistido no meio do caminho
Quando a chuva escorria na telha
E a mesa mais farta era a do vizinho
Quantas vezes me senti sozinho
Incapaz de olhar pro espelho
Mas capaz de exercer minha fé
E expressar minha dor chorando de joelho
Lembro do sonho das Audi, da fumaceira no breu
Da playboyzada e dos Opala e as queima de pneu
Vi quatro amigo meu ir pro crime de otário
Vi cinco preto na favela virar empresário
Tanto faz se minha mãe já chorou
Se o sorriso dela tá tão lindo
É que hoje eu posso te dar
Um abraço mais puro, um carro, um vestido
E se fosse por quem já falou
Que o moleque não ia durar
Que trocou o revólver no amor
E quis cantar rap, não quis estudar
[Pré-Refrão]
Agora é champ e nave rebaixada
O jet no engate da danada
Daqui pra Riviera é quase nada
Descendo a Baixada, sente a acelerada"

Se quita su ropa, se pone mi jersey
Dice que mi aroma la pone bien crazy
Me gusta pa' baby, le gusto pa' sugar
Quizá lo consiga, no es nada taruga
Me cae de madruga', se queda tres días
Les dice en su casa que está con su amiga
Me puso en el muro que la hiciera mía
Me mandó un mensaje con fotografía
Se lo contesté y la miré el mismo día
Yo solo quería andar de caliente
Checarle el aceite, aventarle un palenque
Pero pa' mi suerte, que andaba de buenas
Qué chula viejona cayó pa' la cena
Bebimos champaña y azúcar morena
No fuimos al gym pero valió la pena
Ya hicimos el cardio pa' toda la sema'"

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love
[Verse 2]
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night
[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love
[Verse 3]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round"

[Intro]
Mi amor, necesito hablar contigo
Quiero que me perdones
Sé que fui una estúpida, fui una tonta
Pero quiero que me perdones
Necesito volver contigo, perdóname
Que no sé qué hacer, estoy desesperada
Necesito volver contigo
Mi amor, perdóname
Sé que fui una estúpida, soy una tonta, una idiota
Pero por favor, mi amor, perdóname
Te lo suplico
[Verso]
Cómo te digo que no quiero hablar contigo
Que estoy mucho mejor desde que te has ido
Me dejaste como Alejandro Sanz, con el corazón partido
Así que no me des cotorra y vete por donde has venido
No quiero saber de ti, interesada
No volvería contigo aunque estuvieras embarazada
Si me ves en la calle, mejor no digas nada
Para que la hermana mía no te dé par de trompadas
Me da igual si te enfadas o me llamas hijoepu'
Pero tienes que bajarle algodón a tu actitud
Mi loca, te vo'a dar una lu'
Tu primita que estudia bachillerato chinga más rico que tú
Buh, cambiaste oro por cobre
Ahora no te asombres si cuando me llamas nadie te responde
Tú me abandonaste, te fuiste con otro hombre
Porque prefieres ser la puta de un rico que la princesa de un pobre
Mejor que borres lo que pasó entre nosotros
Que no vuelvo a metértelo ni con el huevo de otro
Tienes el toto roto y el culo también
Porque tú solo te enamoras de los billetes de cien
Que te den, ya no voy a aguantar tus gilipolleces
Ahora tengo cinco novias, dime, ¿qué te parece?
Mujer del diablo, de mi vida desaparece
Ya me tienes harto, no te lo voy a decir más veces
A mí no me cuentes cuentos
Lamento decirte que ya pasó tu momento, lo siento
¿Amor de qué? Yo no estoy en sentimiento
Déjame tranquilo y no me hagas perder el tiempo
No vayas de mega diva que eres del montón
Ni que fueras Pamela Anderson
Das el chocho a cambio de unos Jordan y un iPhone
Eso en mi barrio se llama prostitución
Te gusta rapar y no hablo del concón
Tus amigas dicen que lo haces sin condón
Dejas que te den por el culo cuando tienes la menstruación
Te la das de seriecita y lo que eres un cuerón
Vas al salón, disque a ponerte bonita
Pero tú no estás buena, ni aunque te echen sopita
Te saqué lo pies, ya tú chabelita
A mí dame banda de chiquito timbal Lupita
Conmigo deja tu maldita locura
Que lo que se bota no se recoge de la basura
Mi amor, ¿tú te quieres ver dura?
Pues cásate con un viejito y que te pague una lipoescultura
Qué cura, te crees que estás buena
La sinceridad, tú lo que estás dando es pena
No sabes ni cocinar, el arroz siempre se te quema
Lo único que hacías más o menos bien era mamarme la ñema
Morena, te voy a ser sincero
No hay mujeres feas, lo que hay son hombres sin dinero
Pero lamentablemente, yo ya no te quiero
Y tú nunca podrás olvidar al Kinkillero"

Mi spiace baby ma sei l'ultimo dei pensieri miei

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (Shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care"

903,Every Rose Has Its Thorn - Remastered 2003,Poison,71,Open Up And Say...Ahh! (20th Anniversary Edition),1988-03-21,rock,260173,"My name is Assata Shakur, and I am a 20th century escaped slave. Because of government persecution, I was left with no other choice than to flee from the political repression, racism and violence that dominate the US government's policy towards people of color. I am an ex-political prisoner, and I have been living in exile in Cuba since 1984.
I have been a political activist most of my life, and although the U.S. government has done everything in its power to criminalize me, I am not a criminal, nor have I ever been one. In the 1960s, I participated in various struggles: the black liberation movement, the student rights movement, and the movement to end the war in Vietnam. I joined the Black Panther Party. By 1969 the Black Panther Party had become the number one organization targeted by the FBI's COINTELPRO program. Because the Black Panther Party demanded the total liberation of black people, J. Edgar Hoover called it ""greatest threat to the internal security of the country"" and vowed to destroy it and its leaders and activists.
In 1978, my case was one of many cases bought before the United Nations Organization in a petition filed by the National Conference of Black Lawyers, the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, exposing the existence of political prisoners in the United States, their political persecution, and the cruel and inhuman treatment they receive in US prisons. According to the report:
The FBI and the New York Police Department in particular, charged and accused Assata Shakur of participating in attacks on law enforcement personnel and widely circulated such charges and accusations among police agencies and units. The FBI and the NYPD further charged her as being a leader of the Black Liberation Army which the government and its respective agencies described as an organization engaged in the shooting of police officers. This description of the Black Liberation Army and the accusation of Assata Shakur's relationship to it was widely circulated by government agents among police agencies and units. As a result of these activities by the government, Ms. Shakur became a hunted person; posters in police precincts and banks described her as being involved in serious criminal activities; she was highlighted on the FBI's most wanted list; and to police at all levels she became a 'shoot-to-kill' target.""
I was falsely accused in six different ""criminal cases"" and in all six of these cases I was eventually acquitted or the charges were dismissed. The fact that I was acquitted or that the charges were dismissed, did not mean that I received justice in the courts, that was certainly not the case. It only meant that the ""evidence"" presented against me was so flimsy and false that my innocence became evident. This political persecution was part and parcel of the government's policy of eliminating political opponents by charging them with crimes and arresting them with no regard to the factual basis of such charges.
On May 2, 1973 I, along with Zayd Malik Shakur and Sundiata Acoli were stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike, supposedly for a ""faulty tail light."" Sundiata Acoli got out of the car to determine why we were stopped. Zayd and I remained in the car. State trooper Harper then came to the car, opened the door and began to question us. Because we were black, and riding in a car with Vermont license plates, he claimed he became ""suspicious."" He then drew his gun, pointed it at us, and told us to put our hands up in the air, in front of us, where he could see them. I complied and in a split second, there was a sound that came from outside the car, there was a sudden movement, and I was shot once with my arms held up in the air, and then once again from the back. Zayd Malik Shakur was later killed, trooper Werner Foerster was killed, and even though trooper Harper admitted that he shot and killed Zayd Malik Shakur, under the New Jersey felony murder law, I was charged with killing both Zayd Malik Shakur, who was my closest friend and comrade, and charged in the death of trooper Forester. Never in my life have I felt such grief. Zayd had vowed to protect me, and to help me to get to a safe place, and it was clear that he had lost his life, trying to protect both me and Sundiata. Although he was also unarmed, and the gun that killed trooper Foerster was found under Zayd's leg, Sundiata Acoli, who was captured later, was also charged with both deaths. Neither Sundiata Acoli nor I ever received a fair trial We were both convicted in the news media way before our trials. No news media was ever permitted to interview us, although the New Jersey police and the FBI fed stories to the press on a daily basis. In 1977, I was convicted by an all- white jury and sentenced to life plus 33 years in prison. In 1979, fearing that I would be murdered in prison, and knowing that I would never receive any justice, I was liberated from prison, aided by committed comrades who understood the depths of the injustices in my case, and who were also extremely fearful for my life.
The U.S. Senate's 1976 Church Commission report on intelligence operations inside the USA, revealed that ""The FBI has attempted covertly to influence the public's perception of persons and organizations by disseminating derogatory information to the press, either anonymously or through ""friendly"" news contacts."" This same policy is evidently still very much in effect today.
On December 24, 1997, The New Jersey State called a press conference to announce that New Jersey State Police had written a letter to Pope John Paul II asking him to intervene on their behalf and to aid in having me extradited back to New Jersey prisons. The New Jersey State Police refused to make their letter public. Knowing that they had probably totally distort the facts, and attempted to get the Pope to do the devils work in the name of religion, I decided to write the Pope to inform him about the reality of' ""justice"" for black people in the State of New Jersey and in the United States. (See attached Letter to the Pope).
In January of 1998, during the pope's visit to Cuba, I agreed to do an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza around my letter to the Pope, about my experiences in New Jersey court system, and about the changes I saw in the United States and it's treatment of Black people in the last 25 years. I agreed to do this interview because I saw this secret letter to the Pope as a vicious, vulgar, publicity maneuver on the part of the New Jersey State Police, and as a cynical attempt to manipulate Pope John Paul II. I have lived in Cuba for many years, and was completely out of touch with the sensationalist, dishonest, nature of the establishment media today. It is worse today than it was 30 years ago. After years of being victimized by the ""establishment"" media it was naive of me to hope that I might finally get the opportunity to tell ""my side of the story."" Instead of an interview with me, what took place was a ""staged media event"" in three parts, full of distortions, inaccuracies and outright lies. NBC purposely misrepresented the facts. Not only did NBC spend thousands of dollars promoting this ""exclusive interview series"" on NBC, they also spent a great deal of money advertising this ""exclusive interview"" on black radio stations and also placed notices in local newspapers.
DISTORTIONS AND LIES IN THE NBC SERIES
In an NBC interview Gov. Whitman was quoted as saying that ""this has nothing to do with race, this had everything to do with crime."" Either Gov. Whitman is completely unfamiliar with the facts in my case, or her sensitivity to racism and to the plight of black people and other people of color in the United States is at a sub-zero level. In 1973 the trial in Middlesex County had to be stopped because of the overwhelming racism expressed in the jury room. The court was finally forced to rule that the entire jury panel had been contaminated by racist comments like ""If she's black, she's guilty."" In an obvious effort to prevent us from being tried by ""a jury of our peers the New Jersey courts ordered that a jury be selected from Morris County, New Jersey where only 2.2 percent of the population was black and 97.5 percent of potential jurors were white.
In a study done in Morris County, one of the wealthiest counties in the country, 92 percent of the registered voters said that they were familiar with the case through the news media, and 72 percent believed we were guilty based on pretrial publicity. During the jury selection process in Morris County, white supremacists from the National Social White People's Party, wearing Swastikas, demonstrated carrying signs reading ""SUPPORT WHITE POLICE."" The trial was later moved back to Middlesex County where 70 percent thought I was guilty based on pretrial publicity I was tried by an all-white jury, where the presumption of innocence was not the criteria for jury selection. Potential jurors were merely asked if they could ""put their prejudices aside, and ""render a fair verdict."" The basic reality in the United States is that being black is a crime and black people are always ""suspects"" and an accusation is usually a conviction. Most white people still think that being a ""black militant"" or a ""black revolutionary"" is tantamount to being guilty of some kind of crime. The current situation in New Jersey's prisons, underlines the racism that dominates the politics of the state of New Jersey, in particular and in the U.S. as a whole. Although the population of New Jersey is approximately 78 percent white, more than 75 percent of New Jersey's prison population is made up of blacks and Latinos. 80 percent of the women in Jersey prisons are people of color. That may not seem like racism to Gov. Whitman, but it reeks of of racism to us.
The NBC story implied that Governor Christie Whitman raised the reward for my capture based on my interview with NBC. The fact of the matter is that she has been campaigning since she was elected into office to double the reward for my capture. In 1994, she appointed Col. Carl Williams who immediately vowed to make my capture a priority. In 1995, Gov. Whitman sought to ""match a $25,000 departmental appropriation sponsored by an ""unidentified legislator."" I watched a tape of Gov. Whitman's ""testimony"" in her interview with NBC. She gave a very dramatic, exaggerated version of what happened, but there is no evidence whatsoever to support her claim that Trooper Foerster had ""four bullets in him at least, and then they got up and with his own gun, fired two bullets into his head."" She claimed that she was writing Janet Reno for federal assistance in my capture, based on what she saw in the NBC interview. If this is the kind of ""information"" that is being passed on to Janet Reno and the Pope, it is clear that the facts have been totally distorted. Whitman also claimed that my return to prison should be a condition for ""normalizing relations with Cuba"". How did I get so important that my life can determine the foreign relations between two governments? Anybody who knows anything about New Jersey politics can be certain that her motives are purely political. She, like Torrecelli and several other opportunistic politicians in New Jersey came to power, as part- time lobbyists for the Batistia faction - soliciting votes from right wing Cubans. They want to use my case as a barrier for normalizing relations with Cuba, and as a pretext for maintaining the immoral blockade against the Cuban people.
In what can only be called deliberate deception and slander NBC aired a photograph of a woman with a gun in her hand implying that the woman in the photograph was me. I was not, in fact, the woman in the photograph. The photograph was taken from a highly publicized case where I was accused of bank robbery. Not only did I voluntarily insist on participating in a lineup, during which witnesses selected another woman, but during the trial, several witnesses, including the manager of the bank, testified that the woman in that photograph was not me. I was acquitted of that bank robbery. NBC aired that photograph on at least 5 different occasions, representing the woman in the photograph as me. How is it possible, that the New Jersey State Police, who claim to have a detective working full time on my case, Governor of New Jersey Christine Whitman, who claimed she reviewed all the ""evidence,"" or NBC, which has an extensive research department, did not know that the photograph was false? It was a vile, fraudulent attempt to make me look guilty. NBC deliberately misrepresented the truth. Even after many people had called in, and there was massive fax, and e-mail campaign protesting NBC's mutilation of the facts, Ralph Penza and NBC continued to broadcast that photograph, representing it as me. Not once have the New Jersey State Police, Governor Christine Whitman, or NBC come forth and stated that I was not the woman in the photograph, or that I had been acquitted of that charge.
Another major lie and distortion was that we had left trooper Werner Foerster on the roadside to die. The truth is that there was a major cover-up as to what happened on May 2, 1973. Trooper Harper, the same man who shot me with my arms raised in the air, testified that he returned to the State Police Headquarters which was less than 200 yards away, ""To seek aid."" However, tape recordings and police reports made on May 2, 1973 prove that not only did Trooper Harper give several conflicting statements about what happened on the turnpike, but he never once mentioned the name of Werner Foerster, or the fact that the incident took place right in front of the Trooper Headquarters. In an effort to hide his tracks and cover his guilt he said nothing whatsoever about Foerster to his superiors or to his fellow officers.
In a clear attempt to discredit me, Col. Carl Williams of the New Jersey State Police was allowed to give blow by blow distortions of my interview. In my interview I stated that on the night of May 2, 1973 I was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back. Williams stated ""that is absolutely false. Our records show that she reached in her pocketbook, pulled out a nine millimeter weapon and started firing."" However, the claim that I reached into my pocketbook and pulled out a gun, while inside the car was even contested by trooper Harper. Although on three official reports, and when he testified before the grand jury he stated that he saw me take a gun out of my pocketbook, he finally admitted under cross-examination that he never saw me with my hands in a pocketbook, never saw me with a weapon inside the car, and that he did not see me shoot him.
The truth is that I was examined by 3 medical specialists: (1) A Neurologist who testified that I was immediately paralyzed immediately after the being shot.
(2) A Surgeon who testified that ""It was absolutely anatomically necessary that both arms be in the air for Mrs. Chesimard to receive the wounds."" The same surgeon also testified that the claim by Trooper Harper that I had been crouching in a firing position when I was shot was ""totally anatomically impossible.""
(3) A Pathologist who testified that ""There is no conceivable way that it [the bullet] could have traveled over to hit the clavicle if her arm was down."" he said ""It was impossible to have that trajectory"" The prosecutors presented no medical testimony whatsoever to refute the above medical evidence.
No evidence whatsoever was ever presented that I had a 9-millimeter weapon, in fact New Jersey State Police testified that the 9-millimeter weapon belonged to Zayd Malik Shakur based on a holster fitting the weapon that they was recovered from his body.
There were no fingerprints, or any other evidence whatsoever that linked me to any guns or ammunition.
The results of the Neutron Activation test to determine whether or not I had fired a weapon were negative.
Although Col. Williams refers to us as the ""criminal element"" neither Zayd, or Sundiata Acoli or I were criminals, we were political activists. I was a college student until the police kicked down my door in an effort to force me to ""cooperate"" with them and Sundiata Acoli was a computer expert who had worked for NASA, before he joined the Black Panther Party and was targeted by COINTELPRO.
In an obvious maneuver to provoke sympathy for the police, the NBC series juxtaposed my interview with the weeping widow of Werner Foerster. While I can sympathize with her grief, I believe that her appearance was deliberately included to appeal to people's emotions, to blur the facts, to make me look like a villain, and to create the kind of lynch mob mentality that has historically been associated with white women portrayed as victims of black people. In essence the supposed interview with me became a forum for the New State Police, Foerster's widow, and the obviously hostile commentary of Ralph Penza. The two initial programs together lasted 3.5 minutes - me - 59 seconds, the widow 50 seconds, the state police 38 seconds, and Penza - 68 seconds. Not once in the interview was I ever asked about Zayd, Sundiata or their families. As the interview went on, it was painfully evident that Ralph Penza would never see me as a human being. Although I tried to talk about racism and about the victims of government and police repression, it was clear that he was totally uninterested.
I have stated publicly on various occasions that I was ashamed of participating in my trial in New Jersey trial because it was so racist, but I did testify. Even though I was extremely limited by the judge, as to what I could testfy about, I testified as clearly as I could about what happened that night. After being almost fatally wounded I managed to climb in the back seat of the car to get away from the shooting. Sundiata drove the car five miles down the road carried me into a grassy area because he was afraid that the police would see the car parked on the side of the road and just start shooting into it again. Yes, it was five miles down the highway where I was captured, dragged out of the car, stomped and then left on the ground. Although I drifted in and out of consciousness I remember clearly that both while I was lying on the ground, and while I was in the ambulance, I kept hearing the State troopers ask ""is she dead yet?"" Because of my condition I have no independent recollection of how long I was on the ground, or how long it was before the ambulance was allowed to leave for the hospital, but in the trial transcript trooper Harper stated that it was while he was being questioned, some time after 2:00 am that a detective told him that I had just been brought into the hospital. I was the only live ""suspect"" in custody, and prior to that time Harper, had never told anyone that a woman had shot him.
As I watched Governor Whitman's interview the one thing that struck me was her ""outrage"" at my joy about being a grandmother, and my ""quite nice life"" as she put it here in Cuba. While I love the Cuban people and the solidarity they have shown me, the pain of being torn away from everybody I love has been intense. I have never had the opportunity to see or to hold my grandchild. If Gov. Whitman thinks that my life has been so nice, that 50 years of dealing with racism, poverty, persecution, brutality, prison, underground, exile and blatant lies has been so nice, then I'd be more than happy to let her walk in my shoes for a while so she can get a taste of how it feels. I am a proud black woman, and I'm not about to get on the television and cry for Ralph Penza or any other journalist, but the way I have suffered in my lifetime, and the way my people have suffered, only god can bear witness to.
Col. Williams of the New Jersey State Police stated ""we would do everything we could go get her off the island of Cuba and if that includes kidnaping, we would do it."" I guess the theory is that if they could kidnap millions of Africans from Africa 400 years ago, they should be able to kidnap one African woman today. It is nothing but an attempt to bring about the re- incarnation of the Fugitive Slave Act. All I represent is just another slave that they want to bring back to the plantation. Well, I might be a slave, but I will go to my grave a rebellious slave. I am and I feel like a maroon woman. I will never voluntarily accept the condition of slavery, whether it's de-facto or ipso- facto, official, or unofficial.
In another recent interview, Williams talked about asking the federal government to add to the $50,000 reward for my capture. He also talked about seeking ""outside money, or something like that, a benefactor, whatever."" Now who is he looking to ""contribute"" to that ""cause""? The Ku Klux Klan, the Neo Nazi Parties, the white militia organizations? But the plot gets even thicker. He says that the money might lure bounty hunters. ""There are individuals out there, I guess they call themselves 'soldiers of fortune' who might be interested in doing something, in turning her over to us"" Well, in the old days they used to call them slave- catchers, trackers, or patter-rollers, now they are called mercenaries. Neither the governor nor the state police say one word about ""justice."" They have no moral authority to do so. The level of their moral and ethical bankruptcy is evident in their eagerness to not only break the law and hire hoodlums, all in the name of ""law and order."" But you know what gets to me, what makes me truly indignant? With the schools in Paterson, N.J. falling down, with areas of Newark looking like a disaster area, with the crack epidemic, with the wide-spread poverty and unemployment in New Jersey, these depraved, decadent, would-be slave-masters want federal funds to help put this ""nigger wench"" back in her place. They call me the ""most wanted woman"" in Amerika. I find that ironic. I've never felt very ""wanted"" before. When it came to jobs, I was never the ""most wanted,"" when it came to ""economic opportunities I was never the ""most wanted, when it came to decent housing."" It seems like the only time Black people are on the ""most wanted"" list is when they want to put us in prison.
But at this moment, I am not so concerned about myself. Everybody has to die sometime, and all I want is to go with dignity. I am more concerned about the growing poverty, the growing despair that is rife in Amerika. I am more concerned about our younger generations, who represent our future. I am more concerned that one-third of young black are either in prison or under the jurisdiction of the ""criminal in-justice system."" I am more concerned about the rise of the prison-industrial complex that is turning our people into slaves again. I am more concerned about the repression, the police brutality, violence, the rising wave of racism that makes up the political landscape of the U.S. today. Our young people deserve a future, and I consider it the mandate of my ancestors to be part of the struggle to insure that they have one. They have the right to live free from political repression. The U.S. is becoming more and more of a police state and that fact compels us to fight against political repression. I urge you all, every single person who reads this statement, to fight to free all political prisoners. As the concentration camps in the U.S. turn into death camps, I urge you to fight to abolish the death penalty. I make a special, urgent appeal to you to fight to save the life of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the only political prisoner who is currently on death row.
It has been a long time since I have lived inside the United States. But during my lifetime I have seen every prominent black leader, politician or activist come under attack by the establishment media. When African -Americans appear on news programs they are usually talking about sports, entertainment or they are in handcuffs. When we have a protest they ridicule it, minimized it, or cut the numbers of the people who attended in half. The news is big business and it is owned operated by affluent white men. Unfortunately, they shape the way that many people see the world, and even the way people see themselves. Too often black journalists, and other journalists of color mimic their white counterparts. They often gear their reports to reflect the foreign policies and the domestic policies of the same people who are oppressing their people. In the establishment media, the bombing and of murder of thousands of innocent women and children in Libya or Iraq or Panama is seen as ""patriotic,"" while those who fight for freedom, no matter where they are, are seen as ""radicals,"" ""extremists,"" or ""terrorists.""
Like most poor and oppressed people in the United States, I do not have a voice. Black people, poor people in the U.S. have no real freedom of speech, no real freedom of expression and very little freedom of the press. The black press and the progressive media has historically played an essential role in the struggle for social justice. We need to continue and to expand that tradition. We need to create media outlets that help to educate our people and our children, and not annihilate their minds. I am only one woman. I own no TV stations, or Radio Stations or Newspapers. But I feel that people need to be educated as to what is going on, and to understand the connection between the news media and the instruments of repression in Amerika. All I have is my voice, my spirit and the will to tell the truth. But I sincerely ask, those of you in the Black media, those of you in the progressive media, those of you who believe in truth freedom, To publish this statement and to let people know what is happening. We have no voice, so you must be the voice of the voiceless.
Free all Political Prisoners, I send you Love and Revolutionary Greetings From Cuba, One of the Largest, Most Resistant and Most Courageous Palenques (Maroon Camps) That has ever existed on the Face of this Planet."

Tonight, it's very clear
'Cause we're both lying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone
[Chorus]
I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love
[Verse 3]
You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone"

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me and I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beating for you, I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay
[Chorus]
See, my days are cold without you (Without you)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (Oh, whoa)
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you (Keep on running back to you)
See, my days are cold without you (Without you)

Ok, i'm chilling in my house
Next thing you know i'm on the floor just like a mouse
I already said that rhyme anyway
I'm on the freaking floor and I have no time, wey
I have an iron deficiency
So every time when I stand up I can't see
Because i'm passed out
On the floor seeing nothing, i'm about
To die
Next thing you know I feel a sharp pain in my thigh
I'm in the hospital
[Argument With Jim, The Studio Guy]
Wait, was I supposed to start there? Jim, you're not telling me anything. I'm- The-. You didn't say you were recording so why would you tell me you were recording and then reprimand me for literally rapping. Like, i don't get it. That's why i didn't say anything because i thought we weren't starting. See, Jim, this is why i'm gonna fire you
[Outro]
Okay, that's the end of this song
I know that every fact was pretty wrong
And i'm kinda trash, so i'm gonna go
You just never know

[Intro: Greeicy]
(Greeicy)
[Verso 1: Greeicy]
Hace tanto tiempo que no estás
Y no encontré a nadie que me quiera
Nadie me besó a tu manera
Y ya no tengo ganas de buscar
Yo seguí escuchando tu canción
La que te dediqué de primera
Pero es que para serte sincera
[Pre-Coro: Greeicy & 
Nacho
]
Se me juntaron la suerte con las ganas de verte
Y si te tengo de frente no me digas que no
Precisamente esta noche que no vine a buscarte
Te apareces de frente, no me digas que no
 (
Greeicy
)
[Coro: Greeicy & 
Nacho
]
Pregúntale al destino por qué nos enamoró (
Por qué nos enamoró
)
Pregúntale al camino que por qué nos separó (
Tú sabes qué nos pasó
)
Tú sabes la respuesta, siempre he sido tuya
Y solamente, solamente tuya
Y solamente, solamente tú y yo (
Tú y yo, yo, yo
)
Pregúntale al destino por qué nos enamoró (
¿Por qué, pues?
)
Pregúntale al camino que por qué nos separó (
Camínale
)
Tú sabes la respuesta, siempre he sido tuya
Y solamente, solamente tuya
Y solamente, solamente tú y yo

Ich hol' dir, was du brauchst, sogar die Juwelen
Und sind sie hier, wird sie keiner mehr stehlen
Egal, was auch ist, du kannst auf mich zählen
Ich rede bei dir direkt von meiner Seele
Mein Herz aus Stein, ist doch nur eine Rede
Du fühlst dich klein, doch ich lass' dich bald schweben
Tut mir leid, Baby, bitte vergebe
Die Fehler, die ich machte, war'n mir eine Lehre
Ab heute geh'n wir nur noch getrennte Wege
Dieses Ende brachte all dieses Elend
Nehm' ein Glas und betäube mein'n Schädel
Der Whisky brennt so wie Feuer in der Kehle
Der Schmerz, er lenkt mich sowieso in die Quere
Jetzt hör dir an, was ich dir noch so erzähle
Désolé, désolé, désolé"

911,Baby I'm Yours - feat. Irfane,Breakbot,71,By Your Side,2012-09-17,pop,215507,"[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find
Your feelings changed like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on without falling apart?
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind
[Chorus]
Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?
[Verse 2]
Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do 
declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind"

[Verse]
They say, ""Lil' Nahmir, where you been at?"" I'm just passin' a breeze
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on me
I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat 
(
Izak made this one
)
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well, I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be actin' like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent, but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin' C's like they Crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil Corey and Lil Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch, I keep a .40
You say I'm lackin', nigga, try me, shoot you and your shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
40 poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, 
dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta, nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck, nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil Valley, he get slumped, nigga
We shoot his body, then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch, that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil Quay, well then, that nigga gotta go
I'm really small, but I can fight, but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me, ho
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near your head, well, I'ma fuckin' get it, man"

To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get outta here

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty clash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there

Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Baby when we were young
There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat

I don't know where I left my heart anymore
Maybe I never had one
Maybe I forgot it
Inside a briefcase
But I can’t recall where
People wait for miracles
With open arms, yeah, like tentacles
They hope that God will solve it all
But that's not how it goes, no no no no
These fake smiles make me lose my temper, oh oh, oh oh
Not even you believes what you'rе saying, I know
The way to success makes you win monеy
It makes you lose friends, oh no
Kids and burglars at my concerts
[Chorus: Mahmood]
Calypso
Run, kid, in the alleys
A hundred sirens in the corners
Nobody will search your heart
Calypso
You search the streets for miracles
Others tell you: ""C’est la vie""
Now you remember where your heart is
Now remember where your heart is
Calypso
La la la la
Calypso
Now remember where your heart is"

Mój ziomo w 1 LO zjarał Amsterdam pierwszego września
Po to, by nauczycielka myślała, że tak już ten ma z natury
No i do matury mówił jej, że to alergia
Mój ziomo miał piersiówę, którą uzupełniał
W termosie trzymał wódę i ściemniał profesorom, że to herba
Dom-szkoła w złotówie, dom-szkoła w Uberkach
Mój ziomo z mym ziomem za pieniądze starych
Na białych tych szkołach pykali w pokerka
Mój ziomo coś wygrał, mój ziomo coś przegrał
Mój ziomo z mym ziomem walili wiaderka
Na piętnastkach no i dwudziestkach
I wiosna za budą, a zimą, gdy zimno na dworze, to kitrali się po łazienkach
Mój ziomo miał Supreme, mój ziomo miał Bape'a
Mój ziomo na uro dostał te kluczyki od Merca
Na czarno Ukry sprzątały mu penthouse
Mój ziomo chciał wypłatę starego przećpać
Nie pykło, bo była tak wielka
Że dużo prędzej by tu kopnął w kalendarz (ej)
Mój ziom się powiesił w Sylwestra
A ciągle pamiętam, jak kradliśmy te flaszki z Kerfa
I jak je piliśmy na hejnał o 8:20

Glory
Glory
[Verse 1]
This is not another story
This is not another drill
I refuse to be another number now, never staying down
This is something real
I'm a name that you'll remember
I am more than just a thrill
I am gonna be the greatest ever now; watch out
I'm a force that you will feel
[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes something like (Woo-ooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-ooh)
It's my time (Woo-ooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this
[Chorus]
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)"

I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me
[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
[Verse 2]
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me, there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do
[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself"
929,Rebel Yell,Billy Idol,71,Rebel Yell,1983-11-01,rock,288533,"[Verse 1]
Last night, a little dancer a-came dancin' to my door
Last night, a little angel came pumpin' on my floor
She said, ""A-come, baby, you got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above,"" because
[Chorus]
In the midnight hour, she cried, ""More, more, more""
With a rebel yell
, she cried, ""More, more, more,"" wow!
In the midnight hour, babe, ""More, more, more""
With a rebel yell
, ""More, more, more
More, more, more""
[Verse 2]
She don't like slavery
, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
A-what set you free and brought you to me, babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me, because
[Chorus]
In the midnight hour, she cried, ""More, more, more""
With a rebel yell
, she cried, ""More, more, more,"" wow!
In the midnight hour, babe, ""More, more, more""
With a rebel yell
, ""More, more, more""
[Bridge]
A-he lives in a-his own Heaven
Collects it to go from the 7-Eleven
Well, he's out all night to collect a fare
A-just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair

Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
[Chorus: Tony Lewis]
I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight
[Verse 2: Tony Lewis, 
Tony Lewis & John Spinks
]
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover
[Chorus: Tony Lewis]
I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
[Bridge: Tony Lewis]
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone

In my trap house, man
I got this, y'all
[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr., Mr. Magic & Trouble]
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunked, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?
[Verse 1: Mr. Magic]
I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle, I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes, I'm checking my foes
As I spit at police and duck my P.O.'s
I ain't going to court, you can call a judge
Tell him kiss my ass 'cause I ain't gon' budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to broke
And I'm never gon' stop the puffing
Not for nothing
The block, they need me
The streets, they need me
The club scene, nigga
Is mine, believe me
You don't believe me?"

When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
[Chorus]
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
[Verse 2]
We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of"
934,Escape (The Pina Colada Song),Rupert Holmes,71,Partners In Crime,1979-01-01,rock,276493,"[Verse 1]
I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read
[Chorus]
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad"

Games, changes and fears
When will they go from here?
When will they stop?
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together, babe
But we're not
[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning
[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey!"

Le mani su, eh
Fra’ lo sto facendo per la cultura
Sto fumando l’erba illegale
Questa merda vi fa paura
Questa merda vi fa leccare
Meglio MadMan che fa ‘sti soldi
Qualcun altro è senz’altro peggio
Fai il bonifico o vai di assegno
No, non prendo niente a noleggio
Delle macchine, fra’, non scherzo
Non me n’è mai fregato un cazzo
Fino a quando ho guardato il prezzo
Poi il mio saldo e ho pensato: “Cazzo!”
Ho più sbatti per queste tasse
Che tatuaggi sopra le braccia
Quindi, frate', se non c’è cash
Di MadMan non ne compare traccia
M ammazza, sono il capo capo
Con la salsa, mica sciapo sciapo
Faccio i soldi Piero l’avvocato
Fatto su un 220 nero scappottato
Cambio auto, voglio il cambio auto (
Wuh
)
Voglio un Evoque cabrio bianco immacolato
Quando passo pensi: ""Come cazzo ha fatto?""
L’ho davvero fatto, scacco matto, tutto calcolato
Come fa?"

You're the only thing that's on my mind

Compra un vestido escoge la cena, sé mi delirio yo tu condena

Seu sorriso vale bem mais que um diamante
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hoje a noite vai ser de verdade
Finge que não, mas ela sabe
O melhor caminho pra se aproximar de mim
Nós nem começamo e já tamo bem longe do fim
A gente combina igual tabaco e cerveja enfim
A gente combina igual Red Amarelo e gin
Foi tão bonito ver
Você rebolando a noite toda sem se arrepender
Dizendo que não vai mais lutar pra tentar me esquecer
Prazer no olhar de todas as linda que de rolé na minha vida
Deixaram essa chama acesa mesmo sem querer
Mato e morro pelos cria que tão sempre no rolê

Hidin' be talkin' shit and goin' silent
Told her if I pop my shit back, she goin' wet like it's trident
Flow on Poseidon, if I die tomorrow all at least I know I'm really 'bout it
Fuck whoever doubt it
I knew you was a goofy from the jump but I allowed it
I never get surprised when the joker doin' some clown shit
I knew you was a dog, it don't shock me when you be houndin'
New problems every day, I maneuver my way around them
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?"

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me"

In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

Ayer me dijeron tus amigas

Con unos parceros dañándome la cabeza
Borracho con el corazón malo
Caminando solo, me la encontré a ella

Me dejé enredar fácil, caí en las garras de ella
Mujer tan bella y yo con una botella
Me dejé enredar fácil, caí en las garras de ella

(Maluma, baby, prr)
Me cogiste en un momento de debilidad
Yo jurándome que nunca más te iba a tocar
Todo por culpa de esas malditas cervezas
Con esos labios en frente, quién no te besa (Muah)
Porque no fui capaz de ahí mismo darle stop
En el ranking de mi' culo' siempre fuiste el top
Nos cagamos los dos solos en la relación
Lo dejamos a lo loco, así sin protección"

Years go by
I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin' to me

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath
It's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover

I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away

I will not fade

Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind"

That we should be together

If all things in time, time will reveal

Tú, llegaste a mi vida para enseñarme
Tú, supiste encenderme y luego apagarme
Tú, te hiciste indispensable para mí
Y, y, 
y con los ojos cerrados te seguí
Si yo busqué dolor, lo conseguí
No eres la persona que pensé
Que creí, que pedí
[Coro: Mario Domm & Samo]
Mientes, me haces daño y luego te arrepientes
Ya no tiene caso que lo intentes
No me quedan ganas de sentir
Llegas cuando estoy a punto de olvidarte
Busca tu camino en otra parte
Mientras busco el tiempo que perdí
Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti
[Verso 2: Samo & 
Mario Domm
]
Voy, de nuevo recordando lo que soy
Sabiendo lo que das y lo que doy
En mí no queda espacio para ti
Y, y, y, 
y, y el tiempo hizo lo suyo y comprendí
Las cosas no suceden porque sí
No eres la persona que pensé
Que creí, que pedí"

Verse 1
]
It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why, but you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact, and if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days
[
Chorus
]
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
[Verse 2]
It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program!
And if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days"

Day breaks and when I turn
You're not on my pillow
My head shakes and then the penny drops
Still your t-shirt on my chair
Pencilled hearts on paper
I try not to think but I can't stop
And doubt sets in like a storm
I could feel it coming
And words echo out yesterday
Time pushed me to the edge
The jump was my decision
I've only got myself to blame
[Chorus]
'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away
I have no right to miss you
When I didn't wanna stay
And I have no right to need you
When I knew what my heart was gonna lose
I have no right to love you
But I do, I still do
Yeah, I still do

(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)
[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(My body's sayin', ""Let's go"")
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(But my heart is sayin', ""No, no"")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (Yeah)
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do"

I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way

I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my zone
I get down to the beat, I lose control
Eh-oh, I go so-, solo
[Chorus]
Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance

[Intro: Ángel López]
Na-uh, uh-uh, uh
El tiempo pasó como una estrella fugaz
Y nuestro amor falleció sin razón, baby
Quisiera volver a aquel tiempo otra vez
Y poderte detener, pues ya no puedo
[Coro: Ángel López]
Sin tu amor, no sé qué vaya a hacer conmigo
Sin tu amor, no sé cuál sea mi destino
Sin tu amor, el mundo caerá sobre mí
Baby
[Verso 1: Big Boy]
Quisiera volver a amarte, volver a quererte
Volver a tenerte cerca de mí, girl, mis ojos lloran por ti
Quisiera volver a amarte, volver a quererte
Volver a tenerte cerca de mí, girl, mis ojos lloran por ti
Me haces tanta falta y no lo puedo negar
No sé cómo de mi vida te pudiste marchar
Arrancaste mi corazón como un trozo de papel
Jugaste con mi vida y ahora me pregunto por qué
¿Por qué tuve que enamorarme de ti?
Quererte como te quise y luego te perdí
Yo creo que eso no es justo antes los ojos de Dios
Te di tanto amor y tú me pagaste con dolor
Pero algún día te darás cuenta 'e lo que sentía por ti
Y pensarás en mí aunque estés lejos de mí
Ahora solo me quedan aquellos recuerdos
Y en mi corazón una voz que dice ""Te quiero"""

My, my, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
[Chorus]
I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)
[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch"

You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me

Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman

I just got it off the scale"

A saudade fez toc, toc na sua porta
Tu chora e nesse corre, corre ainda me liga
Gagueja se tu pode, pode me ver agora
E aí que você quase explode com a minha vida
Cansado desse meio termo que tu me dá
Eu fui e nesse meio-tempo desapeguei
'Cê embolava o meio-campo quando ligava
Mas eu peguei meu pé de meia e me mandei
Ninguém tem que ser mestre-cuca pra se ligar
Que nessa montanha russa que é o nosso caso
Eu que sou cabeça dura de acreditar
Que nessa roleta russa virei o alvo
Mas isso é só um bate-papo, não bate boca
'Cê deve tá de boca aberta com o que eu te falo
Por hoje é só bye, bye à queima roupa
Prefiro tá sem par que mal amado
[Refrão: PK]
Eu te desejo tudo de bom
Que o melhor tu já perdeu
Te desejo tudo de bom
Que o melhor tu já perdeu"

Late December, back in '63

She was everything I dreamed she'd be

Spinning my head around

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent
[Chorus]
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
[Verse 2]
Third and Lake, it burnt away,
 the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

I was not magnificent"

My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street"

[Refrão: Lourena]
Amor, é que faz tempo que cê me ligou
E eu fiquei aqui a procurar
Motivos que justificassem a tua falta, amor
Não é pedindo pra você ficar
Mas se quiser eu nem vou reclamar
E o que no fundo o que meu coração quer dizer é
Que eu te amo demais e tudo o que eu faço
Me lembra você
Enquanto você me dizia que ia ser pra sempre nós
O mundo acabava em promessas e ainda estamos sós
[Verso: Sant & 
Lourena

Sant!
Essa é minha última carta de amor
Eu falei isso da última vez, lembra?
Que inclusive faz o quê? Um mês?
Nossos clichês têm um quê de déjà vu
Um quê de Djavan e 
MC Marcinho
Calor que aquece o quarto, 
fogo pros vizinhos
Desvendar o segredo do mundo nessa calcinha de renda
É impossível ser feliz sozinho
Sonho de ter a cópia da chave
Um templo de mármore, uma casa na árvore 
e dançar na chuva
Voar feito nave, encaixar feito luva (Feito luva)
Juras feitas mesmo após morte ou cárcere
Linhas que teci pra te vestir
Pra te despir, 
pra não vestir mais despedidas
Sorriremos quando acordar e antes de dormir
Viveremos por todas vidas e nos veremos
Em todas elas e nos teremos 
e assim seremos
Escrito 
como premedito
Pois quando o abraço dormido aperta a saudade
Respire o ar que dividimos, é mais ou menos isso"

[Intro]
[Verso 1]
Silêncio no recinto que a cena chega a ser grave
Ainda há pessoal que não sabe
Onde é que estacionou a nave
Cabe aqui à moça pôr-te a par do que se passas
Para que tu para a próxima não ponhas esse pé na poça
Vens buscar-me de BM a pensar que me impressiona
Fica a saber que esta dona não é assim que funciona
Abres-me a porta do carro, abre a pestana
Sou levada da breca, não boneca de porcelana
Beijo de língua até ao esófago, não saco
Só mesmo alcoolizada é que arco virar o barco
Sex sem latex só há possibilidade
Comigo mesma em total privacidade
Em modo duracell falas da ex infiel
Será que hoje eu estou com cara de lencinho de papel?
Em formato de anel não me venhas cá pôr coleira
Porque eu Marta Isabel até morrer vou ser Bateira
[Skit]
[Verso 2]
Calma aí que eu estou confusa
Queres que a minha tusa fuja?
Eu ainda só tirei a blusa e já tens a cueca suja
Que saia croquete na rifa, estou sujeita
Agora mixa com preguiça, chiça
Não se aproveita...
Ninguém merece...só com um traque é que isto aquece
Não dás com o ponto G nem com prece nem GPS
Há duas horas em posição missionário
Pinto o tecto de bege ou de amarelo canário?
O man geme e grita mais do que eu, evita
Ou metes fita ou o meu pai vem-nos fazer uma visita
Não rola roxo sem lilás
O que é castanho não roda por estas bandas, rapaz
Essa aliança, idiota, vómitos em mim provoca
Eu não contribuo para que damas não passem na porta
Achas-te um espanto?
Não ver em ti algum encanto
Tinhas de nascer de novo e mesmo assim não garanto"

Resentment
[Verse 1]
I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point, but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay
[Chorus]
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up, burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up, lifting me up
[Post-Chorus]
Resentment
[Verse 2]
You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart, all that's unforgiven
Washing over me like rain"

Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off

The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T

So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck

Mesmo sem saber ao certo onde ia chegar
A luz me guia e ilumina mais um dia

Na cidade grande, onde mata ou morre
Esses olho gordo querem tudo que eu tenho
Nunca me adiantaram, então não atrasa, não fode

1074,Here I Go Again - 2018 Remaster,Whitesnake,70,1987 (2018 Remaster),1987,rock,275395,"Way back in '07, /x/ was an interesting place, bursting with new ways to keep you up at night. Stuff like the oldish creepypastas were actually creepy, instead of being something that made you wonder how it ever spooked anybody. In the summer of that year, what was intended as a one-off creepypasta became something explosive. 
SCP-173
, ""The Statue.""
It all started with SCP-173. It was a random, one-off creepypasta, but it inspired a lot of people. before long, other entries started popping up, and then one day someone made a wiki for it, so they wouldn't all 404 eventually. This was when /x/ was still young-ish, and The Holders, Ted the Caver, Treedog, and other old-school /x/ rubbish was still very new and decent. -DrGears
The initial appearance of SCP-173 was something really different to the /x/ community. Instead of being a basic story with a jump scare punchline, or a thing that made you feel squicked and scared, it was designed to make you wonder, and draw fear from that. You can imagine the reaction of many internet dwellers as they first scrolled down to see that thread.
It was popular. The original thread stuck around for a couple days, as many people marveled at the creepiness of the writing and the implication that there were more things just like it somewhere else. But as some were thinking of what could be out there, others wanted to know how they could get their piece of the SCP pie. They became the very first entries to what was then known as ""The SCP Series."" It's also when we got a few of our oldest and earliest shapers of the community, such as DrGears, A Fat Ghost, Kain Pathos Crow, FritzWillie, and Bijhan.
With these writers, we also got some of the oldest and most loved(or hated) entries to the SCP Series. Able is pretty much the first you think of when it comes to this category. He was a creation of Kain, but when he was first created he didn't look how he did today. Rather, he was closer to being the ""Guy what fights good"" many people now decry him as. The concept of Mobile Task Force Omega-7 was in full swing, and the concept of using anomalous objects for the Foundation's benefit was the rule rather than the exception.
DrGears wrote many of his current 42 articles in the old /x/ days. Some, like the now-deleted SCP-031 ""Parasite's Generation"" did not last. However, quite a few gems have survived to this time. SCP-682 was made in its original form, ready to gnash and destroy all it could. But it too has been significantly revised over time. Originally, it didn't have the interview log and had a weaker description. It received its change from an anonymous writer on the EditThis wiki. The Dr. Gears character also came from this time, from a prototype tale. The tale in question was a note reprimanding some researcher for cross-testing two different SCPs, which resulted in the creation of SCP-682. When it was posted to /x/, it brought criticism for being far too emotional and un-scientific. As such, DrGears reshaped the character as a man who has no emotion, deeply traumatized by the goings-ons of the Foundation.
Although many users embraced the SCP Series and used the idea well, some were unsatisfied with the limits of merely posting in forum threads. In addition, many denizens of /b/ and /x/ were beginning to grow weary of repeated threads being created. So on January 19th, 2008, the SCP Series wiki was created on the EditThis wikifarm. Most of the entries that were moved to the EditThis wiki were the original works of the users on /x/ and /b/. With the creation of the SCP Series wiki, the community began to post fewer and fewer threads on 4chan, instead writing directly to the wiki. As such, /x/ and /b/ ceased to be the primary medium of these works, with the threads slowly fading away.
The SCP wiki got its start on EditThis, a wikipedia clone. It was unpolished, a little bit sloppy, and in retrospect probably not a great place to start out. The entries were displayed on a big list, similar to the one we have. Communication between different members of the community was difficult to accomplish, since the discussion page as we know it did not exist, and the pages where we could communicate were primitive. This junction is also where we gained other influential members, such as Bright and Eberstrom. It's still possible to see some of the old comments by using the wayback machine on EditThis.
Eberstrom was definitely one of the most influential members of the old wiki, yet has been buried in the dustbin of history. Looking through many of his posts on the old discussion pages, it is obvious he was very influential, and was well known by DrGears, Kain, and FritzWillie. His 001 proposal was one of the first on the site, and the oldest one to survive from EditThis(In -ARC form).
The entries on EditThis grew from less than 200 to many hundreds over the course of a couple months. The SCP-001 proposals did not exist, as the number 001 was initially held in abeyance, with the label ""reserved until someone makes an entry worthy of SCP-001."" Several SCP-001 Proposals were eventually created: Eberstroms Proposal(Site-19), Catalyst's Proposal(Also Site-19), DrGears Proposal(The Prototype), Jonathan Ball's Proposal(The Sheaf of Papers), and Taisaijin's Proposal(A Lost God). Only DrGears and Ball's proposal's still exist, with Eberstrom's having been -ARC'd and the rest deleted.
Joke articles date back from the EditThis wiki, where they consisted primarily of pop culture references and the like. We had stuff from various books, movies and comics, with an entire series of objects based on the portal series. When the wiki was ported to WikiDot, there was some discussion about deleting the joke entries altogether, since at the time they occupied normal SCP number slots. They were eventually moved to their current section, with the pop-culture entries purged during the Mass Edit.
Additional influential entries were made during this time, exclusively on EditThis. Josie the Half cat was one of the first major entries to be posted on EditThis, and was popular enough that the first SCP logo was based on her appearance. You can see it here! DrGears also wrote a significant number of articles, posting entry after entry to the SCP Series main page. Many of the Broken God and MC&D stuff, as well as his classic articles1 were written at this time.
It was during the EditThis days that the scientific rigor we hold all articles to began to take shape. Prior to this, many authors casually disregarded basic science and mathematics in order to make their entries. As time went on and more additions were made to the series, people began to make more and more unscientific articles. People got sick of it, and on March 23rd, 2008, a user named Aiden made this post on the SCP Series discussion:"

Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children.
 The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. 
Whistles call and answer.
THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.
THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.
(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, 
jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance.
 A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)
THE CHILDREN 
Kithogue
l Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) 
Grhahute!
THE CHILDREN 
Where's
 the great light?
THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.
(They release him. He jerks on. A 
pygmy
 woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of 
rags and bones
. A 
crone
 standing by with a 
smoky
 oil lamp 
rams
 the last bottle in the 
maw
 of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A 
bandy
 child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken 
navvy
 ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a 
scrofulous
 child.

You keep on takin' from me
I wonder where you went
You keep on takin' from me
But where's my ten percent?

Why you tryna lie for them?
Pretending who you are
But baby, why even pretend?
You're trying way too hard
Ego is not your friend
I only speak the truth
No, I'm not trying to offend
But why you tryna lie for them?
[Verse]
I wake up, it's so good to be me
In the mirror, it's good to see me
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness
You just don't have a clue who to be
Look in your eyes, I see the envy
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness"

And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, no

I like to see you, but then again

Tú te la pasas de aquí pa' allá
Yo me la paso de allá pa' acá
Diciendo que no nos queremos ma'
Diciendo que nos olvidamos, que va
Tú te la pasas de aquí 
pa' allá
Yo me la paso de allá pa' acá
Que pa' sus labios 
yo no vuelvo más
Y me dice que no me desea más
, que va

Que va, que va, que va, que va
Que vaina que ya no te tengo
Pero no te quiero buscar, que va
Que va, que va, que va, que va
Que vaina que ya no te tengo
Pero no te quiero buscar, que va
[Verso 1: Ozuna]
Dime bebé qué fue
Sé que está esperando que te busque
Pero yo no soy más como tú te crees
Viene otra, igual la quiero
No creas que por tu amor yo me muero
Viajo el mundo por si algún día la veo
Pero baby, yo sé que tú estuviste pa' mí
Pero confiaste en que mi corazón era pa' ti
Yo sólo decidí olvidarte
Pero te juro que si tú me llamas"

Suona il telefono, sveglia alle tre
Siri, che giorno è?
Poi ti chiedo: ""Ordiniamo che il frigo è già vuoto?""
E fai strada per un DJ set
Io che non ho mai amato lunghe file per entrare
Non ti sembra così strano incrociarsi in un locale?
Perché tu
[Ritornello: Elodie]
Con quell'aria delicata
Con un fiore tra le dita
Bevi un altro Margarita-a
Poi mi dici che è finita
Che da quando sei tornato (Oh-oh)
Mangi solo granita
E in un fine settimana-a
Guarda come sei cambiato

1088,2000 Miles - 2007 Remaster,Pretenders,70,Learning To Crawl [Expanded and Remastered],1984,rock,220427,"        It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.
        We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practised since. But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them was handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now. But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in 
the weekly bill of mortality
 in the usual manner, thus—
Plague, 2. Parishes infected, 1.
        The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed 
all over the town
, and the more, because in the last week in December 1664 another man died in the same house, and of the same distemper. And then we were easy again for about six weeks, when none having died with any marks of infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that, I think it was about the 12th of February, another died in another house, but in the same parish and in the same manner.
        This turned the people's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town, and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles's parish more than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town, and that many had died of it, though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible. This possessed the heads of the people very much, and few cared to go through Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected, unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it
        This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a week, in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St Andrew's, Holborn, were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more or less; but from the time that the plague first began in St Giles's parish, it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably. For example:—
From December 27 to January 3 { St Giles's 16
""                                                { St Andrew's 17
""       January 3      ""        ""      10 { St Giles's 12
""                                                { St Andrew's 25
""       January 10     ""        ""      17 { St Giles's 18
""                                                { St Andrew's 28
"" January 17 "" "" 24 { St Giles's 23
""                                                { St Andrew's 16
"" January 24 "" "" 31 { St Giles's 24

Throw another one up in the grave, I don't need an AK

I cannot speak, only dig deep
Into abysmal depression to find what I cannot unsee
I'm a fiend for the

Fuck the fame, fuck the drugs, I'm on cloud nine

It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""

That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

When I'm speaking it's the voice of someone else

I tried to hold on, but it hurts too much
I tried to forgive, but it's not enough
To make it all okay

You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel

Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)

I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait

She said she'd, ""Love to rendezvous""
She asked me, ""What we were gonna do?""
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two"

And I don't know why
Can't  seem to say just what I mean

So  many people, all of the ones surrounding me
And if you'd ask them, they would describe me differently
So  many reasons, so many different sides of me
And I can't decide who I want to be

'Cause some people make me bitter
Smile and then squeeze a lime in my cut
And  some people make me sweeter
'Cause they make me feel like I am enough
And that makes me a giver
But my mom says I tend to give too much
And some people make me better
And that's how I know my favorite part of me is you

Hoje me sinto inspirado, sou um homem de sorte
Voando mais alto, ficando mais forte
Note que todo menino é um rei
Hoje eu sei, eu estourei um malote
No banco do carona, ela é maravilhosa
Ouvindo Madonna, dançando, espaçosa
Azul e rosa, reflexo neon
Toda convicção pode ser perigosa
Com ela a vida tem momentos incríveis
Com ela todos meus sonhos são mais possíveis
Lucros invisíveis são melhores
Separados somos fortes, juntos imbatíveis
A estrada da vida é a mesma da morte
O ronco do motor consegue ser mais forte
Defendo o malote, nós que conquistamos
Com competência e fé ignoramos sorte

Montei o meu esquema, hoje eu tô de nave
Eu e minha pequena na velocidade
Olhos cor de pérola, luz da cidade

And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town

If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says
“15 miles to the
Love Shack”
Love Shack, yeah, yeah
I'm heading down the Atlanta highway
Looking for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car that's as big as a whale
And we're heading on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler that seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money
The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby

Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack

Sign says (
woo!

'Cause love rules at the Love Shack”
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch

How many kisses are left in the air?
How many times are we going to try it?

Another time that I call again
And you hang up again
This can't be our end

How so you don't wanna see me?

You say you don't wanna lose me

How so you don't wanna see me?
At least say it to my face
Don't pretend you don't feel anything

Let's stop playing games for once
Let's forgive each other and start from scratch
Let's bet who will be the first to kiss"

Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it (You can love it)
Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, you've never had control
[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
[Verse 2]
I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear"

I'm so high, feeling this vibe
I can’t get over you, I can't get over you
I see your face everywhere I go
I can't get over you, I know
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel that sun on your face
Enjoy the most of your days
You’re 'bout to feel something great
When you hear this drop coming
I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I, you, I, you
I, you, I, you
I, you, I, you

[Intro]
Creaste en mí una nueva ilusión
Me recordaste que existe el amor
Y aunque perdida estuvo mi alma
No volverás junto a mí (No volverás junto a mí)
[Verso 1]
Tu mirada no me engañará más
Tus besos ya no saben igual
Otra mujer te roba el sueño
Ya no eres mío, pero te quiero igual
[Pre-Coro]
No vuelvas a mí, aunque te quiero
No vuelvas a mí, aunque te extraño
Te necesito aquí
Pero tu amor ya no es para mí
[Coro]
Todavía me acuerdo de ti
Todavía siento que estás junto a mí
Ni el tiempo, ni el espacio
Podrán borrar lo que me hiciste soñar
Creaste en mí una nueva ilusión
Me recordaste que existe el amor
Y aunque perdida estuvo mi alma
Ya no estarás más junto a mí"

Pipe it up PJ

[Chorus]
T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there’s both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke
Man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows
Man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home
Man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke
Tryna do me for both
They want me back on soch', using chips and rice
Tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow bones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both
[Verse 1]
Me and T Buck see two opps on the mains
And we ended up doing up both
Too much beef on the streets
We're hitting two blocks and we're shooting up both
I know feds want me back up in courts
Sat in front of the judge just doing up oath
How many times in jail was it bread and oats?
Put peanut butter on both
Now they say that I'm the king of drill
Trap, rap, I'm doing it all
Everywhere and everywhere, the gang's smokey
Let the gangdem bring it on tour
Every day I hear niggas tryna draw me out
Why they all want me to war?
.44 long and that poisonous scopes
They don't want us bringing out both"

I left in the pouring rain
Saying I wouldn't be home again
I get so caught between everything I feel
I'm stubborn and I won't say sorry
Write it out 'cause I know that you worry
Wonder where I've been
Got you questioning
[Pre-Chorus]
These tears are making me blind, I don't know why
I start a forest fire and burn us down
But you know at the end of the night, I'll come around
[Chorus]
Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed
Maybe you made mistakes that got me on my knees
And maybe we're a mess, but it works for me
'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me
[Verse 2]
You keep to your side of the bed now
Cold shoulder, turning your head
Saying things that you don't mean, painful honesty
You cut me right through the centre
Throw my hands up, but I won't surrender
When did words become all our weapons? Mmh"

I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance
[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
[Chorus]
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you

Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

Well, anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I, I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel (Make me feel)
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales (Than your fairy tales)
Better than your best dreams (Your best dreams)
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I, I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it

Ich will die Kette, die Roli, die Limo, nur weil sie mir steht

Schnapp' mir die Kohle und ficke den Fame
Baller Pistole, zerficke dein Brain
Veysi Carpone, nein ich bin nicht ohne Geschäfte mit Drogen, hab' vieles geseh'n
Bestelle, verpacke, verticke das Gras

Chill' in den Bars schon um viertel nach Acht

You will never know, it's the price I pay

Shake, shake yourself

Quizás perdí en la batalla porque el que merece no pide
Que me amara y quisiera de la forma en que yo lo hice
Es que amar con habilidad nunca ha sido posible (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yo no me niego al amor, no me niego a nada que me dé pasión
Yo no me niego a sus besos que son traicionero' y matan de dolor
Si soy sentimental
Cuando te acuestes con alguien
Ya tú verás que no es igual, lo vas a lamentar (Eeeeh)"

I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains
[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed
[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
[Verse 2]
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to"

Die Schlampe, sie will Yayo (Yayo)
Sie ruft mich schon wieder an
Und sagt, sie will noch paar Gramm von mir haben
Sie will Yayo (Yayo)
Aber ich weiß nicht, wie lang
Ich heute noch mit ihr kann, diese Schlampe will nur Yayo
[Post-Hook: Capo]
Sie mag es, die Art wie
Ich sie hart fick', Jean Paul Gaultier, Baba
Ich pack' sie am Hals und mach' ihr ganz schnell klar:
„Ich muss leider weg, denn dein Mann ist ein Gangster“
[Part 1: Undacava]
Sie kennt mein'n Kopf, sie zieht es drauf
Sie spielt sich auf, sie zieht sich aus
Sie liebt das Geld, sie liebt den Staub
Sie liebt den Benz, ich lieb' ihn auch
Sie liebt den Sekt, ich liebe Frau'n
Tier im Bett, sie ist viel zu laut
Kriegt nicht genug, sie liebt den Sex
Es schien perfekt, doch jetzt fliegt sie raus
Sie denkt, sie wär's
Dreh' im Benz meine Runden
Sieht die Welt verkehrt
Sie dachte, es wird kommen
Sie erkennt ihr'n Wert
Nix weiter als 'ne Puppe
Ich muss Geld vermehr'n
Verdreifache die Summe mit"
