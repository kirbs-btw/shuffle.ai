Run away, but we're running in circles

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go

And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go"

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me"

'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday,

But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya

I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think

It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear

Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin'

Bazaar

Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)

[Intro]
(Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh)
Si te vas, yo quiero saber si tú te vas
Mami, cuando tú quieras, cuando tú quieras, yeh, yeh
[Coro]
Vete, eh-eh-eh
Nadie te está aguantando y la puerta está abierta, eh
No te preocupe' por nosotro' do', nuestra historia ya está muerta
Espero que seas feliz y que te diviertas, eh
Pero pa' acá no vuelvas, no-no-no-no
Vete, eh-eh-eh
Nadie te está aguantando y la puerta está abierta, eh
No te preocupe' por nosotro' do', nuestra historia ya está muerta
Espero que seas feliz y que te diviertas, eh
Pero pa' acá no vuelvas, no-no-no-no
[Verso]
Ey, dime, ¿qué esperas?
Baby, te quiero, pero afuera
Ere' alguien por dentro y otra por fuera
Y ya no siento nada cuando te encuera'
Dame-dame banda, eh
En mi corazón ya tú no ere' la que manda
Se acabó, por ti ya no siento nada
De nuestra serie ya no salen temporada'
Así que vete lejo', dile al diablo que te envíe el pin
Hace tiempo que no somo' un team
Pa'l carajo nuestro aniversario y San Valentín
Ya no hay más Christian Lou ni los traje' en satén
Síguelo, que está verde, eh
Que tiene' la culpa, es lo que te muerde
Quédate con el perro, pa' que de mí te acuerde'
Y piense' en to' lo que te pierde'"

Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak"

Did i really just forget the food?
Naw, no no, nonono! no no , (shoot) nono nononono
When i jumped down to the cave, i found a little bit of diamonds
Maybe some coal, i go to the savana to ice biome
Inventory so low i got nothing to give to villagers villagers
Run out the base
I swing my sword like (ding ding ding)
I got you're diamonds so hahaha
I swing my sword like (ding ding ding)
I got you're diamonds so hahaha
How do i raid like that?
Oh god, i was raided, by 8 players
I wonder how (how i fell for that)
I protected my base when i was gone
I wonder how (how i fell for that)
Married to the mind, i got my pickaxe
It storming but i wish i had a roof
Honest with the admins with items
Finally got my items, i say my thanks"

Summer-vibe reminisce the summer-time
Cause I know these past few days haven't been so nice
Trying to meet my expectations but they don't suffice
Feel like quitting but I owe it to myself to try
A different technique, new flow same beat
Promise you it's still heat, opposite of obsolete
Yo Michael don't you copy me, nah chill you know I body beats
Give myself a breather cuz I know you'd rather hear me speak
Spanish so fluently, this is what influence me
Latin sounds with R&B and all these sounds regarding me but
Pardon me, I've hardly seen the payoff of what's a part of me
Still watering my gardening, my inner roots are hardening
And begging to be news now, on the come up we don't lose now
In the maxima we cruise out, ain't no way we gonna snooze now
Gotta press the gas and zoom out, get me out of this shit
Bored of rapping in English so we gon-go ahead and switch like
[PRE-Chorus]
El no fue asi, el no fue asi no se que lo cambio
El no fue asi, el no fue asi no se que lo cambio

Pero, I know I'm on my grind just like a mocajete
Porque quiero que la gente me respete por mi arte solo gracias a Dios
Que tengo el apollo de mi gente, saludos a J Balvin
""no la crean inocente"" Como dice El Bad Bunny pero tampoco yo
Y no lo digo por presumir, pero simplemente eso ser mi
En el party divertid y en sol a sonreir porque eso es vivir
De la via, la bebida, la amiga y el amigo pinche Onomatopoeia
Como formo esta rima, tan caliente que te cambio yo el clima
Y me hecho todo ensima, dame hate, dame like, dame lo que usted
Opina de El MIC ON MIC, shit I'm gon be alright, partying all night
Getting lit we hype, ain't no worry in sight, letting loose on each verse. Cause when it comes to being quite man you know that I'm the worse C'mon
[Chorus]
E E E E E El no es Callaito pero pa la musica es vivo y lo se
Tienes que ver lo vivo, como no me olvido quien el es
El no es Callaito pero pa la musica es vivo y lo se
Tienes que ver lo vivo, como no me olvido quien el es

Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?"

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

Chorus
]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go
[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face"

Tú sabe' las cosita' que te hiciera (Hiciera)
Tal vez si de tu parte tú pusieras (Pusiera')
Como comida caliente te comiera (Comiera)

The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan
I needed me a die or rider, I need me the one
I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier"

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before
[Verse 1]
I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels
To be open and then find out your love isn't real
I'm still hurting, yeah, I'm hurting inside
I'm so scared to fall in love, but if it's you, then I'll try
[Chorus]
It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you

Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say

But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna
And I know you won't tell nobody nothin'
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming
[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper"

It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said you loved me first (First)
One thing my dad told me was
""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time you're insecure""
I can't see it through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?"

It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard (No, oh)
[Verse 2]
You look at me (Look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (Push right through me)

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

No, they don't like it when I'm down

I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground

Doctor Love
[Verse 1]
Living life all wrong
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
But my heart, it was made of stone
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
But all that glows ain't always gold
[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing
[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same
[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh
[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love"

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body"

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over

Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever"

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break"

I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play, they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot with a hundred some shottas
I be swimmin' with the sharks, lil' nigga, you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shout out to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas
[Verse 1]
My niggas trappin' out the bando, shout out to the Migos (The Migos)
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole (Grrah)
The trap always open, bitch, we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos
Step one, step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hundred some drums like a band in this bitch
Man, she keep on bitchin', all that naggin' and shit
Ho, shut the fuck up and just gag on this dick
I'm a side nigga, and I love when she swallow
If her nigga say something, hit him with a hollow
That glizzy
 (Yeah), knock your meat out your taco (Your taco)
Flexin' on these bitches, they call me Johnny Bravo
School of hard knocks, let me take you to class
My bitch is real skinny, but she got a lot of ass
I love counting money, I get a lot of cash
If you try to take it from me, his toe gon' have a tag, yeah"

I tried to reach you, I can't hide
How strong's the feeling when we dive
Across the ocean of my mind
My wounds are healing with the salt
All my senses intensified
Whenever you and I, we dive
Across the ocean of my mind
But in the end, I drown
You pushed me down, down

I felt pain

You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
[Verse 2]
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby, I got everything and so much more than she's got

I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure
[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door
[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

Yeah, I got you

Maniac
[Verse 1]
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my 
home
, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
[Pre-Chorus]
People like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash
[Chorus]
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac
[Post-Chorus]

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
 
(
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like"""

Yeah, yeah
[Refrão: Meek Mill]
Eu costumava foder meu reabastecimento
Agora, é o jato com meus pés no alto
Eu tenho o dinheiro e poder
Agora nenhum desses manos pode nos ver
Eu uso casaco de pele um atrás do outro (Pele)
Eu provavelmente tô brigado com a PETA
Eu tenho que pagar pra deixar ela
Provavelmente é mais barato ficar com ela
[Pós-Refrão: Roddy Ricch]
Eu ando com cerca de 20 mil dentro da Lam' SUV, o mano desliza, parça
Eu acabei de colocar 20 mil pela cabeça dele, o muleque fuzila, parça
Eu recebi uma bolsa, depois dupliquei (Dupliquei)
Toda essa conversa, não tá acrescentando (Acrescentando)
Esses manos pedem um tratado de paz
Vadia, eu tenho aumentado a estática
[Verso 1: Roddy Ricch]
Mano, eu tô me transformando em selvagem (Selvagem)
Bentley, Rolls Royce na frota, ayy
Eu aposto que a arma tem alcance
Eu ainda guardo ela embaixo do banco
Eu coloco elásticos no dinheiro pra viver, eu posso guardar a grana em um casaco de pele (Casaco)
E eu tenho Fiji comigo, ela confundiu meu Patek com uma pia
Eu tava em Dallas no V-Live, o modelo da corrente é igual uma colmeia
Ele disse que quer treta com um mano, vi ele nas ruas, ele não tem coragem, ayy
Eles sabem que os Crips são coisa séria, ayy
Rostos azuis na minha Amiris
Temos uma van de vadias chegando, eu gosto de deixar minhas vadias safadas curiosas
Eu só encomendei um Rolls Royce com o interior da Gucci (Interior), ayy
Quando eu tava no quarteirão com as miras lasers, eles pensaram que era Natal
Chego no quarteirão e nocauteio ele, encontramos eles dormindo
Estávamos trabalhando naquela casa vazia, Deus, me perdoe (Me perdoe)"
182,Wake Me Up,Avicii,84,True,2013-01-01,pop,247427,"[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
Feelin' my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me
[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
[Build]
[Drop]
[Verse 2: Aloe Blacc]
I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize"

I don't want a valentine,
 
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine,
 
I just want Valentino

Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed

I fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid, my diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy
I'm a young, rich nigga, bitch, it's always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship,
 
we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face"

But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die"

Run that back, Turbo
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made"

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Oh, take a step, uh
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still runnin', dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions"

[Verso]
A gente tinha combinado
Que já tava tudo errado
Que não dava mais
Marcamos o ponto final
Mas o final é sempre igual
Você me faz voltar atrás
[Pré-Refrão]
Enche de perfume no corpo
E um sorriso que me deixa louco
Com a intenção de provocar
Como é que eu largo dela?
[Refrão]
E a gente fez amor, oh oh
Era pra terminar, quem disse que eu consigo?
E a gente fez amor, oh oh
Como se fosse o último pedido
E a gente fez amor, oh oh
Era pra terminar, quem disse que eu consigo?
E a gente fez amor, oh oh
Como se fosse o último pedido"

Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surround by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
 (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes"

[Intro: Sech]
(This is the remix)
Otra noche que, llamó pa' verme
Tiene kush y haze también, pero sola no prende
[Refrán: Zion]
(Z-Diddy)
Dice que no fuma, pero si yo prendo, ella le da, ella le da
Me dio un beso y le sentí allá abajo la humedad, uh-yeh
Es como andar en el mar navegando a ciegas
Eres una fantasma y no dejas que te vea
[Coro: Myke Towers & 
Farruko
]
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va'
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da (
Pu-pum
)
Eso le da cuando está en la soledad
Se castiga sin piedad, tú te viene' y te va' (
Viene' y te va'
)
Ella y las amiga' son una sociedad
Y saben lo que va a pasar con los mío' si se da
[Verso 1: Sech]
(Este es Se')
Es que si se da después del concierto
Quedamo' adentro de tu apartamento
Tú no ere' de aquí, lo noto por tu acento
No es amor, pero grita: ""¡Lo siento!""
Yo no soy de darle repeat, siempre lo escribo en lo' tweet'
Voy a hacer un tutorial, pa' que te olvides de mí
Que no me saca de su mente
Que regrese, que quedó caliente
Otra noche que, llamó pa' verme
Tiene kush y haze también, pero sola no prende"

You couldn't be mad about it
You've been sailing, sailing‚ ooh
You couldn't be sad about it
And it's been all this time
And you haven't lived without it
You are shining‚ shining‚ it seems though
That your life, you've found it
[Chorus]
No, but you never
No‚ you never seen the rain
No, but you never, no‚ you never seen the rain
And it gets you down
But that's okay
You've been pushed 'round
You feel the pain
And when you fall
Just lean on me
'Cause you've never known
Never seen
Never smelt
Never felt
The rain, rain
Never felt the rain, rain, rain"

Yo, left, right, left

Yo, left, yo, left

Yo, left, right, left

Yo, left, yo, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck"

Solo quiere a alguien que se lo ponga
Ella quiere un man que no la llame y que no joda
Pa' reemplazar al perro que no la valora
Quiere aprovechar que está más buena y más de moda

Pero es ella misma queriendo salir del daño

Do whatever I want, don't give a fuck, live my life, uh-huh, uh-huh
I got your wife, she my slut, she take nut, uh-huh, uh-huh
And I don't walk shit at all, I'm on the money run
I don't got no opps, they stay inside 'cause they scared of my guns
Your bitch said she want a real one, I told her, ""Come and find one""
It's funny how you pussy, but you never been inside one
Ayy, these dumb-ass, virgin-ass niggas mad
They run when they see the gun in my hand
Bullets like Twitter, they follow them

Boy, your chain ain't solid gold
Your jeweler finessed, he hollowed them (Yeah)
These niggas say they wit' it, uh, we gon' Harry Potter him (Pussy bitch)
Make that lil' bitch disappear (Woo), got VVS's in my ear
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a chandelier, they shinin' on your bitch
We flick these hoes wanna fuck, 'cause I'm so freaky-deaky and your bitch gon' eat me
You know that we killin' these fuck niggas
Hell nah, ain't no throwin' no white flag
Hell nah, pussy boy, we don't buy that
Pussy nigga, pull up on him and bite that, uh

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""
[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay"

I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now
[Chorus]
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour of every day
Keeping you safe"

[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""
[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh-hoo
[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

Frightened of this thing that I've become"

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress

Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, 
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
watch you go
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else

Two, don't let him in

244,Thinking out Loud,Ed Sheeran,83,x (Deluxe Edition),2014-06-21,edm,281560,"[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory"

Baby, I like your style
[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style"

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it´, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but"

And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go
[Verse 2]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for (

And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

Livin' easy
Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I’d rather do
Goin' down

My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell

Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around

Playin' in a rocking band
Hey mama

I'm on the way to the promised land

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter"

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like"

[Intro: Ricky Martin]
Aquí otra vez estoy pensándote
No sé por qué te extraño si somos dos extraños, yeah
Comenzó con un beso apresa'o
Y terminó un poco más descarado
Ay, Dios mío, ¿qué fue lo que hicimos? Yeah
[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Es que la noche fue oportuna
Pa' lo que siento no hay vacuna
Y es que yo no te puedo olvidar
Y tu belleza que no me ayuda
Tu abusas, me usas, lo sabes, me gusta
Y por más que trato, oh, oh
[Coro: Ricky Martin & 
Maluma
]
No se me quita, esto no se me quita
El sabor de tu boca, sigue estando en mi boca (Oh, oh, oh)
Eso no hay quién lo frene, fue sin aviso (¡Qué rico!)
Y ahora me tiene la mente en la luna y los pies en el piso
No se me quita, esto no se me quita
El sabor de tu boca, sigue estando en mi boca
 (Oh, oh, oh)
Y eso no hay quién lo frene, fue sin aviso
Y ahora me tiene la mente en la luna y los pies en el piso"

I don't live in California, I'll inform you, that's not where I reside
I'm just a tenant, paying rent inside this body and I
Got two windows, and those windows, well, I call them my eyes
I'm just going where the wind blows, I don't get to decide
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed
[
Chorus
]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, 
I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out
[Verse 2]
So they tranquilized me, analyzed me, threw me back in my cage
Then they tied me to an IV, told me I was insane
I'm a prisoner, a visitor inside of my brain
And no matter what I do, they try to keep me in chains
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed"

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night (Ah)
Drunk on a feelin', alone with the stars in the sky
[Chorus]
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been cryin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
[Drop]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, to get to you
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now, I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm
[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved"

So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

So save it, get gone, shut up

But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessing, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes"

She watched that ""Walker Texas Ranger,"" say I remind her of Nas X

I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

But I'll take my chances either way
[Chorus]
So come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
You look like somebody that could really hold it down (Down)
You look like somebody that would always stick around ('Round)
Got Latina in you, so I know you prolly crazy (Loco)
All my friends said, ""Stay away"", but that shit just don't phase me, uh
Got a little bit of sass, yeah, I like that
You don't take no shit, yeah, you fight back (You fight)
Never let a dude hit it on the first night (No)
I can't even sleep over 'til I wife that (Ahh)
All these bitches in my phone hit the boy, but
I've been curving everyone for you (Brr, brr, brr, brr)
Girl, I would give you every single password
All you gotta do is let me through, yeah"
326,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,82,Recovery,2010-06-18,edm,263373,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
327,Do I Wanna Know?,Arctic Monkeys,82,AM,2013-09-09,rock,272394,"[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you"

Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
[Verse 1]
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
[Pre-Chorus]
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
(no.use)
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I don't eat
You visit in my bad dreams so on nights when I'm lonely you're still right here holding me
But morning's as dark as the evening before it and it's getting harder to breathe all alone
It's only me
My heart is broke and it don't believe you're gone
But the sleeve of scars on my arms brings you along to haunt me wherever I go
I won't move on yet
Something about this loss is just impossible to process
So I obsess over what could've been and how I wasn't enough
Tryna change myself for someone else and punching mirrors till I'm covered in blood"

It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Of every waking hour

Tryin' to keep an eye on you

Oh no, I've said too much

El que come calla'o repite
Con ella, imposible que me quite
Como le fallaron está puesta pa'l desquite
Ella es de control de acceso, pero me dio el beeper
Estuvo conmigo todo el weekend

Piensa-a-an que ya no estoy contigo, oh-ouh
Porque yo no la sigo, la llamo, no le escribo
Y si supieran las cosa' que hacemo' cuando no hay testigo'
Mientra-a-as se mantenga escondido, oh-ouh
Que somo' má' que amigo', que nunca no' comimo'
Pero no' devoramo' y cada cual por su camino
[Verso 2]
Zeta del fino, las copa' de vino
Más nadie intervino
Dije  llégale al lugar que por primera ve' nos vimo'
Descifre su punto débil, pensó que yo era adivino
En la cama somo' uno, en la calle no' dividimo'
Ojalá se les multiplique lo que nos deseen
Tú sabes que yo estoy pa' ti twenty-four seven
Que a nadie le cuento las cosas que suceden
Ella va pa' encima, ella nunca retrocede
Déjalo' que digan lo que quieran
Yo tranquilo me la como en silencio
Contigo ninguno puede inventar
'Toy al tanto pa' el que se ponga menso"

364,Sweet Home Alabama,Lynyrd Skynyrd,81,Second Helping,1974-04-15,rock,283800,"[Intro]
One, two, three
Turn it up
[Verse 1]
Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the 
Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her (
Southern man
)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow
[Chorus]
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
[Verse 3]
In Birmingham they loved
 
the governor
Boo, boo, boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth"
365,Ride,Twenty One Pilots,81,Blurryface,2015-05-15,edm,214507,"[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride
[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?"""
366,Feel It Still,Portugal. The Man,81,Woodstock,2017-06-16,r&b,163253,"[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still"
367,Heathens,Twenty One Pilots,81,Heathens,2016-06-16,edm,195920,"[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse"
368,Fix You,Coldplay,81,X&Y,2005-06-07,pop,295533,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
[Chorus: Chris Martin 
with Will Champion
]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
[Chorus: Chris Martin 
with Will Champion
]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try
 to fix you"

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"

[Verse]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
[Pre-Chorus]
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away"

Is my love too much?
Or is it just enough for you, for you?
'Cause it's getting late, would you like to stay? Ah
'Cause I'm bad at reading signs
[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind
[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Feelings are hard
[Verse 2]
But I feel 'em in my chest
A tiny war within
But when I pull you closer
Girl, I can't explain"

Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy

And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favorite girl

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)

For forty days and for forty nights,
 
the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
 Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)

Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

Ocho de la noche hora local
Yo iba perdida por esta ciudad
La luna fue mi guía, dentro de Gran Vía
Y sin buscarte me ibas a encontrar
[Pre-Coro]
Y tú llegaste a preguntarme como estás
Que guapa, se ve que no eres de acá
Oh no no, oh no no
[Coro]
Oye Pablo, yo no te estaba esperando
Y me dejaste aquí pidiendo más
Un poco más, poquito más
Oye Pablo, tú tienes alma de gitano
Si te hubieras quedado un poco más
Poquito más, tantito más

Me viste desde lejos sola caminar
Con solo una mirada me hiciste temblar
Ya estaba imaginando, mi alma desnudando
Y sin querer, que tonta, di el número mal

Y tú llegaste a preguntarme como estás
Que guapa, se ve que no eres de acá
Oh no no, oh no no"

So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?

(Hey)
[Verse 1]
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""
[Chorus]
He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child
""These are the nights that never die""
My father told me"

'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

You are not the single type
So, baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin', babe)

You just gotta let me try (Try)

Got a call, my nigga died, I damn near skipped a heartbeat
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing
Pull up on the wrong street, 
you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out

Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' bang it out

A lot of choppers when we ride, raise the count up (Raise the count up)
